# 2020-Q03-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses)
- **Primary Concepts**: Matrix inverse, Block matrices, Gaussian elimination
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - COR-2.4.7 (Inverse Using Adjugate)
  - Block matrix properties (not explicitly in items but standard)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Calculation/Application
- **Difficulty Level**: Standard
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Matrix inverse computation
  - Block matrix structures
  - Block diagonal and block anti-diagonal properties
  - Gaussian elimination alternative

## Solution Strategy
1. Recognize block structure in both matrices
2. Apply block matrix inverse formulas
3. Compute inverses of smaller blocks efficiently
4. Assemble final inverses

## Potential Pitfalls
- Missing the block structure
- Errors in block inverse formulas (especially order in anti-diagonal case)
- Computational errors in 3×3 and 2×2 inversions
- Incorrect assembly of final matrices

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Block matrix properties and inverse computation
- **Problem Sheets**: Standard inverse calculations
- **Other Past Papers**: 2021-Q03, 2022-Q03 feature similar matrix structures

## Mark Analysis
- 6 marks total
- Part (a): 3 marks - recognizing structure + correct inverse
- Part (b): 3 marks - similar evaluation
- Efficiency of method vs full Gaussian elimination rewarded

## Question Characteristics
- Tests structural recognition
- Rewards efficient problem-solving
- Standard computational question
- Clear correct answer
