# 2020-Q04: Determinant of Linear Operator and Isomorphism

## Question Statement
Let $\alpha: v_{1}, v_{2}, v_{3}, v_{4}$ be a basis of the vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ be the linear operator such that for any $1 \leq i \leq 4$,
$$
\phi\left(v_{i}\right)=a v_{i}+b \sum_{j=1}^{4} v_{j}
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are two complex numbers.

(a) Compute the determinant of $\phi$.

(b) For what values of $a$ and $b$ is $\phi$ an isomorphism?
