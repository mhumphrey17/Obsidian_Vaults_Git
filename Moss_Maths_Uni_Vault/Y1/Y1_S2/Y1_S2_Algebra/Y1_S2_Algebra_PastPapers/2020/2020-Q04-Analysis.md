# 2020-Q04-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps, Bases) and Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses)
- **Primary Concepts**: Linear operator, Matrix representation, Determinant, Isomorphism
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-1.6.1 (Matrix Representation)
  - DEF-1.6.3 (Linear Operator)
  - DEF-2.3.5 (Determinant of Operator)
  - DEF-1.3.5 (Isomorphism)
  - COR-2.2.4 (Determinant and Invertibility)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Application/Construction/Calculation
- **Difficulty Level**: Challenging
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Matrix representation construction
  - Determinant computation (symbolic)
  - Connection between isomorphism and invertibility
  - Row operations and determinant manipulation

## Solution Strategy
1. Construct matrix representation from given operator definition
2. Compute determinant using strategic row operations
3. Apply isomorphism criterion via determinant

## Potential Pitfalls
- Errors in building the matrix representation
- Mistakes in determinant calculation with parameters
- Forgetting to check both conditions (a ≠ 0 and a ≠ -4b)
- Computational errors with symbolic algebra

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Matrix representations and determinants
- **Problem Sheets**: Operator representations, determinant properties
- **Other Past Papers**: 2021-Q04, 2022-Q04 test similar operator theory

## Mark Analysis
- 6 marks total
- Part (a): 4 marks - matrix construction (2) + determinant (2)
- Part (b): 2 marks - applying isomorphism criterion

## Question Characteristics
- Multi-step problem combining concepts
- Requires symbolic manipulation
- Tests deep understanding of operator-matrix connection
- Non-routine determinant calculation
