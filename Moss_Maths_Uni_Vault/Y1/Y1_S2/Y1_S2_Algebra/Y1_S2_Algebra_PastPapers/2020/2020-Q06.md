# 2020-Q06: Linear Operator on 2x2 Matrices - Basis and Rank-Nullity

## Question Statement
Let $V=M_{2,2}(\mathbb{R})$ be the vector space of $2 \times 2$ matrices over $\mathbb{R}$ and let $A=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$. Denote by $E_{i j}$ the elementary matrix in $V$ such that $E_{i j}$ has 1 at the $(i, j)$-entry and 0 elsewhere, and let $\alpha: E_{11}, E_{12}, E_{21}, E_{22}$ be the list of the elementary matrices in $V$. Define the linear operator $\Theta: V \rightarrow V$ by $X \mapsto A X$.

(a) (i) Define what it means for a list of vectors in a vector space to be a basis.
    (ii) Show that the list $\alpha$ is a basis of $V$.
    (iii) Find the matrix that represents the linear operator $\Theta$ with respect to the basis $\alpha$.

(b) (i) Define the rank and the nullity of a linear map.
    (ii) State the Rank-Nullity-Theorem.
    (iii) Find a basis of $\operatorname{Ker} \Theta$ and compute the rank of $\Theta$.
