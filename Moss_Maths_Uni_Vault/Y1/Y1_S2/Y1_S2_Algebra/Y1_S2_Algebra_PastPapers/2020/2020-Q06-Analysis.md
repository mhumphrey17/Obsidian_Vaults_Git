# 2020-Q06-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps, Bases)
- **Primary Concepts**: Basis, Matrix representation, Rank, Nullity, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Kernel
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-1.4.2 (Basis)
  - DEF-1.6.1 (Matrix Representation)
  - DEF-1.8.1 (Rank)
  - DEF-1.9.1 (Nullity)
  - THM-1.9.2 (Rank-Nullity)
  - DEF-1.3.6 (Kernel)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Mixed (Recall/Justification/Application/Calculation)
- **Difficulty Level**: Challenging
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Basis definition and verification
  - Matrix representation construction
  - Kernel computation
  - Rank-Nullity Theorem application
  - Linear independence verification

## Solution Strategy
