# 2020-Q05: Eigenvalues of Rotation Matrix and Matrix Powers

## Question Statement
Let $A=\begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta & \sin \theta \\ -\sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{pmatrix} \in M_{2,2}(\mathbb{C})$.

(a) Compute the eigenvalues of $A$ and find two eigenvectors of $A$ that are linearly independent.

(b) For $\theta=\frac{2 \pi}{2021}$, compute $A^{2021}$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Eigenvectors]]: Vectors preserved in direction by linear transformation
- [[Rotation Matrix]]: Special orthogonal matrix representing rotation
- [[Matrix Powers]]: Repeated multiplication of matrix with itself
- [[Complex Numbers]]: Euler's formula and complex exponentials
- [[Linear Independence]]: Relationship between eigenvectors
