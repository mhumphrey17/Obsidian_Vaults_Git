# 2020-Q07: Adjugate Properties and Differentiation Operator

## Question Statement
(a) Let $A, B \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ be invertible matrices. Show that
    (i) $\operatorname{adj}(A B)=\operatorname{adj} B \operatorname{adj} A$.
    (ii) if $A$ and $B$ are similar, then $\operatorname{adj} A$ and $\operatorname{adj} B$ are similar.
    
    If you use any properties of determinants or adjugates, ensure that these are stated clearly.

(b) Let $V=\{f \in \mathbb{R}[X] \mid \operatorname{deg} f \leq 3\}$ and $W=\{f \in \mathbb{R}[X] \mid \operatorname{deg} f \leq 2\}$, the vector spaces of polynomials with real coefficients in a variable $X$ with degrees as specified. Let $D=\frac{d}{d X}: V \rightarrow W, f \mapsto \frac{d f}{d X}$.
    
    (i) Write down explicit bases of $V$ and $W$ such that with respect to these bases, the linear map $D$ is represented by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
    
    Now view $D$ as a linear operator $V \rightarrow V$.
    
    (ii) Is $D$ diagonalisable?
    
    (iii) Write down an explicit basis of $V$ such that with respect to this basis, the linear operator $D$ is represented by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$.
