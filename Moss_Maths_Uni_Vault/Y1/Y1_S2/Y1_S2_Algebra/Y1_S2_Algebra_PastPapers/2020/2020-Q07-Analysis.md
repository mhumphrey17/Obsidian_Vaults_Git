# 2020-Q07-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapters**: Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses), Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Part (a): Adjugate properties, Similar matrices
  - Part (b): Differentiation operator, Polynomial spaces, Matrix representation, Diagonalizability, Jordan blocks
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-2.4.4 (Adjugate)
  - DEF-1.7.9 (Similar Matrices)
  - DEF-1.6.1 (Matrix Representation)
  - DEF-3.3.1 (Diagonalization)
  - THM-3.4.7 (Diagonalizability Characterization)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Proof/Application/Construction
- **Difficulty Level**: Challenging
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Adjugate formula and properties
  - Proof techniques for matrix properties
  - Matrix representation construction
  - Diagonalizability criteria (algebraic vs geometric multiplicity)
  - Jordan canonical form understanding

## Solution Strategy
1. Part (a): Use adjugate formula and properties of determinants
2. Part (b)(i): Work backwards from desired matrix representation
3. Part (b)(ii): Compute eigenvalues, check multiplicities
4. Part (b)(iii): Construct Jordan chain for given block structure

## Potential Pitfalls
- Order of matrices in adjugate product formula
- Errors in proof techniques
- Incorrect basis construction in part (b)
- Missing the diagonalizability criterion
- Mistakes in Jordan chain construction

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Advanced topics from Chapters 2 and 3, polynomial spaces
- **Problem Sheets**: Matrix properties, diagonalization problems
- **Other Past Papers**: 2021-Q07, 2022-Q07 feature similar advanced topics

## Mark Analysis
- 14 marks total
- Part (a)(i): 3 marks - adjugate product property proof
- Part (a)(ii): 3 marks - similarity of adjugates proof
- Part (b)(i): 3 marks - finding specific bases
- Part (b)(ii): 2 marks - determining diagonalizability
- Part (b)(iii): 3 marks - constructing Jordan basis

## Question Characteristics
- Most challenging question on paper
- Combines theoretical proofs with applications
