# 2020-Q01: True/False Statements on Linear Algebra Fundamentals

## Question Statement
For Question 1, you do not need to justify your answers. For Questions 2-6, please justify your answers and cite clearly any results you use.

**1.** Are the following true or false?

(a) Elementary row operations preserve the rank of a matrix.

(b) Two matrices that represent the same linear operator are equivalent.

(c) Two finite dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if all the bases of the two spaces have the same cardinality.

(d) The rank of a $2020 \times 2021$ matrix over $\mathbb{C}$ can be 2021.

(e) Let $A, B$ be any $2 \times 2$ matrices over the field of two elements $\mathbb{F}_{2}=\{0,1\}$. Then $\operatorname{det}(A+B)=\operatorname{det} A+\operatorname{det} B$.

(f) Similar matrices have the same eigenvectors.
