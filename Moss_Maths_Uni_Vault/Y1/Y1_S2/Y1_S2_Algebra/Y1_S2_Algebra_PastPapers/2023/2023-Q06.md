# 2023-Q06: Rank, Nullity, and Projection Operators

## Question

### Part (a) [6 marks]
(i) Define the rank and nullity of a linear map and state the Rank-Nullity-Theorem.
(ii) Define what it means for a list in a vector space to be a basis.

### Part (b) [9 marks]
Let V = {(x, y, z) | x + y + z = 0} ⊂ R³, and let π: R³ → R³ be a linear operator
such that π∘π = π and Im π = V.

(i) Find a basis for V.
(ii) Show that 0 and 1 are eigenvalues of π, and compute their geometric and
algebraic multiplicities.
(iii) Is π diagonalisable? Justify your answer.

You may assume without proof that if α and β are linearly independent lists in distinct
eigenspaces of π then the concatenation of α and β is also linearly independent.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Fundamental Definitions
- [[Rank]]: Definition as dimension of image
- [[Nullity]]: Definition as dimension of kernel  
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: Fundamental relationship dim V = rank φ + nullity φ
- [[Basis]]: Linearly independent spanning set
- [[Linear Independence]]: Definition and properties
- [[Spanning Set]]: Definition and properties

### Part (b) - Projection Operator Analysis
- [[Subspace]]: V is a subspace of R³ defined by a linear equation
- [[Projection]]: The property π∘π = π characterizes projections
- [[Kernel]]: Relationship between ker π and eigenspaces
- [[Image]]: Given that Im π = V
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Finding eigenvalues using projection properties
- [[Geometric Multiplicity]]: Computing dimensions of eigenspaces
- [[Algebraic Multiplicity]]: Using bounds and relationships
- [[Diagonalisable Linear Operator]]: Criteria for diagonalizability

## Approach

### Part (a)
State the precise definitions and theorem statement.

### Part (b)
1. Find a basis for V using the constraint equation
2. Use the Rank-Nullity Theorem to find dim ker π
3. Use the projection property π∘π = π to find eigenvalues
4. Calculate geometric multiplicities from eigenspace dimensions
5. Determine algebraic multiplicities using bounds and the hint
6. Apply diagonalizability criteria
