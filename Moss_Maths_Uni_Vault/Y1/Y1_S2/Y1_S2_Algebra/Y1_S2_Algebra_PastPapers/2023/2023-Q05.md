# 2023-Q05: Eigenvalues and Orthogonal Diagonalization

## Question
Let
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 2 \\ 0 & 2 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$$

(a) Compute the eigenvalues and their algebraic and geometric multiplicities.
(b) Find an orthogonal matrix P that diagonalises A.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Eigenvalue Analysis
- [[Characteristic Polynomial]]: $\det(A - tI) = 0$
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Roots of the characteristic polynomial
- [[Algebraic Multiplicity]]: Multiplicity of eigenvalue as root of characteristic polynomial
- [[Geometric Multiplicity]]: Dimension of eigenspace $\text{ker}(A - \lambda I)$
- [[Symmetric]]: Note that A is symmetric (relevant for part b)

### Part (b) - Orthogonal Diagonalization
- [[Orthogonally Diagonalizable]]: Finding orthonormal eigenbasis
- [[Spectral Theorem]]: Symmetric matrices are orthogonally diagonalizable
- [[Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]]: May be needed if eigenvectors aren't orthogonal
- [[Orthogonal Transformation]]: Properties of orthogonal matrices
- [[Eigenvector]]: Finding basis for each eigenspace

## Approach

### Part (a)
1. Compute the characteristic polynomial $\det(A - tI)$
2. Find the roots (eigenvalues)
3. Determine algebraic multiplicities from polynomial factorization
4. Calculate geometric multiplicities by finding null space dimensions

### Part (b)
1. Find eigenvectors for each eigenvalue
2. Check orthogonality (expected due to symmetric A)
3. Normalize eigenvectors to form orthonormal basis
4. Construct P with orthonormal eigenvectors as columns

## Solution

## Notes
- A is symmetric, so orthogonal diagonalization is guaranteed (Spectral Theorem)
- The block structure (4 in top-left, 2Ã—2 block below) simplifies computation
- For symmetric matrices, the geometric and algebraic multiplicities always match
