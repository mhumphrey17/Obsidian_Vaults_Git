# 2023-Q07: Inner Products, Linear Systems, and Adjoints

## Question

### Part (a) [3 marks]
Let V be a vector space over C. Define what it means for a map
V × V → C, (v, w) → ⟨v, w⟩
to be an inner product on V.

### Part (b) [4 marks]
Let A = (aᵢⱼ) be a 3 × 3 matrix over C with column vectors c₁, c₂, c₃ and let b = (bᵢ)
be a non-zero vector in C³ such that the dot product $\bar{b} \cdot c_j = 0$ for all j, that is,
$$ \sum_{i=1}^3 \bar{b}_i a_{ij} = 0, \text{ for all } j, $$
where $\bar{b}_i$ is the complex conjugate of $b_i$. Show that linear system Ax = b does not
have a solution.

(Hint: compute $\bar{b} \cdot b$ with the second b replaced by a linear combination of the
column vectors of A.)

### Part (c) [8 marks]
Let V be an inner product space over C and φ: V → V a linear operator.

(i) Define what it means for a linear operator φ* to be an adjoint of φ.
(ii) Let U be a linear subspace of V. Define the orthogonal complement U⊥ of U.
(iii) Show that Ker φ = (Im φ*)⊥ and deduce that rank φ = rank φ*.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Inner Product Definition
- [[Inner Product]]: Definition on complex vector space
- Properties: conjugate symmetry, linearity in second argument, positive definiteness

### Part (b) - Linear Systems and Orthogonality
- [[Inner Product]]: Standard dot product on C³
- [[Orthogonality]]: Vectors orthogonal to column space
- Linear system solvability: connection to column space
- Proof by contradiction technique

### Part (c) - Adjoint Operators and Rank
- [[Adjoint]]: Definition of adjoint operator
- [[Orthogonal Complement]]: Definition and properties
- [[Kernel]]: Properties of kernel and its relationship to adjoint
- [[Image]]: Properties of image and its relationship to adjoint
- [[Rank]]: Equality of ranks for operator and its adjoint
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: Used in deduction

## Approach

### Part (a)
State the three defining properties of a complex inner product:
1. Conjugate symmetry
2. Linearity in second argument  
3. Positive definiteness

### Part (b)
Use proof by contradiction:
1. Assume a solution exists
2. Express b as linear combination of columns
3. Compute $\bar{b} \cdot b$ using linearity
4. Show this leads to contradiction

### Part (c)
(i) State adjoint definition
(ii) State orthogonal complement definition
(iii) Prove equality using definitions, then use dimension arguments
