# 2023-Q03: Linear Operator Matrix Representation and Determinant

## Question
Let V be a 4-dimensional vector space with a basis α: v₁, ..., v₄, and let φ: V → V be
the linear operator defined by φ(v₁) = v₁ and φ(vⱼ) = jvⱼ + vⱼ₋₁ for j ≥ 2.

(a) Find the matrix representing the linear operator φ with respect to the basis α.
(b) Compute the determinant of φ and determine whether φ is invertible.

[6 marks: (a) 3 marks, (b) 3 marks]

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Matrix Representation
- [[Linear Operator]]: A linear map V → V
- [[Matrix Representation]]: The matrix A where column j is the coordinate vector of φ(vⱼ)
- [[Coordinate Vector]]: Representing vectors in terms of basis elements

### Part (b) - Determinant and Invertibility
- [[Triangular Matrix]]: The resulting matrix is upper triangular
- [[Determinant]]: For triangular matrices, det(A) = product of diagonal entries
- [[Invertible Matrix]]: A matrix is invertible iff det(A) ≠ 0

## Approach

### Part (a)
1. For each basis vector vⱼ, find φ(vⱼ) using the given definition
2. Express φ(vⱼ) as a linear combination of the basis vectors
3. Write the coefficients as the j-th column of the matrix A

### Part (b)
1. Identify that the matrix is upper triangular
2. Calculate det(A) as the product of diagonal entries
3. Determine invertibility based on whether det(A) = 0

## Related Problems

- [[PS04-Q03]] - Isomorphism defined by basis mapping
- [[PS06-Q05]] - Determinant calculation by expansion

## Solution
See [[2023-Q03-Solution]]

## Notes
The pattern φ(vⱼ) = jvⱼ + vⱼ₋₁ creates an upper triangular matrix where:
- Diagonal entries are 1, 2, 3, 4
- Super-diagonal entries are all 1
- All other entries are 0
