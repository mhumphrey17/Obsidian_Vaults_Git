# 2023-Q04: Adjugate Matrix and Integer Inverses

## Question
Let A be an n by n matrix over R.

(a) Define the adjugate of A.
(b) Show that if det A = ±1 and the entries of A are all integers, then the entries of A⁻¹ are also all integers.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Adjugate Definition
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: Complete definition
- [[Minor]]: (j,i)-minor of matrix
- [[Cofactor]]: Signed minors $(-1)^{i+j}\mu_{ji}(A)$
- Matrix indexing convention

### Part (b) - Integer Matrix Inversion
- [[Matrix Inversion via Adjugate]]: Formula $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \text{adj}(A)$
- [[Determinant]]: Properties with integer entries
- [[Minor]]: Minors of integer matrices are integers
- Properties of integer arithmetic

## Approach

### Part (a)
Give the precise definition of the adjugate matrix, including:
- The $(i,j)$-entry formula
- Definition of minors
- The sign convention

### Part (b)
1. Use the adjugate formula for matrix inverse
2. Show that minors of integer matrices are integers
3. Apply the given condition $\det A = \pm 1$
4. Conclude that the inverse has integer entries

- [[DEF-2.4.4]] - Formal definition of adjugate

## Solution
See [[2023-Q04-Solution]]

## Notes
- The adjugate (sometimes called adjoint) involves a transpose of the cofactor matrix
- The condition $\det A = \pm 1$ is crucial for ensuring integer entries in the inverse
- This connects determinant theory with practical computation of inverses
