# 2023-Q01: True/False Statements - Vector Spaces and Matrices

## Question
Let U and W be subspaces of a vector space V over C, and let A, B be n×n matrices over C. Are the following true or false?

(a) The intersection of U and W is again a subspace of V.
(b) dim(U+ W) = dim U + dim W.
(c) Any linear map f: V → V can be represented by a square matrix.
(d) det(AB) = det A det B.
(e) det AB = Adet B, where λ∈ C.
(f) A self-adjoint operator is normal.

- [[Subspace]]: Definition and properties
- [[Sum of Subspaces]]: Properties of sums and intersections

### Part (b) - Dimension Formula
- [[Sum of Subspaces]]: The correct dimension formula is $\dim(U + W) + \dim(U \cap W) = \dim U + \dim W$
- [[Dimension]]: Properties of dimension

### Part (c) - Linear Map Representation
- [[Linear Map]]: Definition and properties
- [[Matrix Representation]]: When a linear map can be represented by a matrix

### Part (d) - Determinant Product Formula
- [[Determinant]]: Product formula for determinants
- [[Product Formula for Determinants]]: $\det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B)$

### Part (e) - Determinant and Scalar Multiplication
- [[Determinant Properties Under Elementary Operations]]: Scaling property
- [[Multilinearity of Determinants]]: $\det(\lambda A) = \lambda^n \det(A)$ for $n \times n$ matrix

### Part (f) - Self-adjoint and Normal Operators
- [[Self-adjoint]]: Definition and properties
- [[Normal]]: Definition $T^*T = TT^*$
- Relationship: self-adjoint implies normal
