# 2023-Q02: Skew-Symmetric Matrices - Dimension and Basis

## Question
A matrix A ∈ M₃,₃(R) is skew symmetric iff Aᵀ = −A, where Aᵀ is the transpose of A.
Let V be the linear subspace of M₃,₃(R) consisting of skew-symmetric matrices.

(a) Define the dimension of a vector space.
(b) Find a basis of V and compute the dimension of V.

[6 marks: (a) 1 mark, (b) 5 marks]

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Dimension Definition
- [[Dimension]]: The number of vectors in any basis of a vector space
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set

### Part (b) - Basis and Dimension of Skew-Symmetric Matrices
- [[Subspace]]: V is a subspace of M₃,₃(R)
- [[Basis]]: Construction of basis elements using elementary matrices
- Skew-symmetric property: Aᵀ = −A implies:
  - aᵢⱼ = −aⱼᵢ for all i,j
  - aᵢᵢ = 0 for all i (diagonal entries must be zero)

## Approach

### Part (a)
State the definition of dimension for a vector space.

### Part (b)
1. Use the skew-symmetric condition to determine the constraints on matrix entries
2. Express a general skew-symmetric matrix in terms of independent parameters
3. Identify basis vectors from the elementary matrices
4. Verify linear independence and spanning property
5. Count the basis vectors to find the dimension

## Related Topics
- [[PS03-Q02]] deals with symmetric matrices (complementary case)
- The space of all n×n real matrices has dimension n²
- For symmetric matrices: dimension is n(n+1)/2
- For skew-symmetric matrices: dimension is n(n-1)/2

## Solution
See [[2023-Q02-Solution]]

## Notes
- Skew-symmetric matrices are the "opposite" of symmetric matrices
- The constraint Aᵀ = −A significantly reduces the degrees of freedom
- The basis construction uses elementary matrices with the skew-symmetric pattern
