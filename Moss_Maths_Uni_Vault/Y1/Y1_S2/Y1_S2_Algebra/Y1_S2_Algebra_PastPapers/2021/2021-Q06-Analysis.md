# 2021-Q06-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps and Bases)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Matrix spaces as vector spaces
  - Basis definitions and tests
  - Linear operators and matrix representations
  - Rank, nullity, and Rank-Nullity theorem
  - Kernel computation
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-1.4.2 (Basis)
  - DEF-1.6.1 (Matrix Representation)
  - DEF-1.8.1 (Rank)
  - DEF-1.9.1 (Nullity)
  - THM-1.9.2 (Rank-Nullity)
  - DEF-1.3.6 (Kernel)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Recall + Application + Construction + Calculation
- **Difficulty Level**: Standard (Some parts easy recall, some challenging computation)
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Basis definitions and properties
  - Matrix multiplication
  - Linear operator representation
  - Kernel computation via row reduction
  - Rank-Nullity theorem application

## Solution Strategy
1. State definitions precisely
2. Use standard basis properties for matrix space
3. Compute operator action systematically
4. Construct matrix representation by columns
5. Solve homogeneous system for kernel
6. Apply Rank-Nullity theorem

## Potential Pitfalls
- Errors in matrix multiplication for operator action
- Incorrect indexing in matrix representation
- Row reduction errors
- Not converting coordinate vectors back to matrices
- Misapplying Rank-Nullity formula
- Sign errors in kernel basis construction

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Chapter 1, sections on bases, linear maps, and rank
- **Problem Sheets**: Similar matrix space problems likely in early weeks
- **Other Past Papers**: Q6 often tests matrix representation and rank-nullity

## Computational Structure
- Part (a): Mostly theoretical with some computation
- Part (b): Computational focus with theoretical framework
- Good balance of recall and application

## Key Learning Objectives Tested
1. Understanding of basis concept in context of matrix spaces
2. Ability to compute matrix representations of linear operators
3. Kernel computation skills
4. Application of fundamental dimension theorems
5. Connection between abstract linear algebra and concrete matrix operations

## Pedagogical Value
- Reinforces fundamental concepts in concrete setting
- Demonstrates matrix space as a vector space
- Tests systematic approach to operator representation
- Applies dimension theory to specific examples

## Student Success Indicators
- Clear statement of definitions
- Methodical computation approach
- Proper conversion between representations
- Correct application of theorems
