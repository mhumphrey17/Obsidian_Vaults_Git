# 2021-Q03-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Determinant computation (cofactor expansion)
  - Matrix invertibility
  - Matrix inverse computation (adjugate method)
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-2.1.1 (Determinant)
  - PROP-2.4.2 (Cofactor Expansion)
  - COR-2.2.4 (Determinant and Invertibility)
  - COR-2.4.7 (Inverse Using Adjugate)
  - DEF-2.4.4 (Adjugate)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Calculation/Application
- **Difficulty Level**: Standard/Challenging
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - 3Ã—3 determinant calculation
  - Polynomial factorization
  - Systematic cofactor computation
  - Adjugate matrix construction
  - Algebraic manipulation

## Solution Strategy
1. Use cofactor expansion for determinant
2. Factor the resulting polynomial
3. Apply invertibility criterion
4. Compute cofactors systematically
5. Construct adjugate and compute inverse
6. Simplify the final expression

## Potential Pitfalls
- Sign errors in cofactor computation
- Forgetting to transpose for adjugate
- Algebraic manipulation errors
- Not properly factoring out common terms
- Computational errors in polynomial factorization

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Chapter 2, determinants and inverses
- **Problem Sheets**: Similar symbolic determinant calculations
- **Other Past Papers**: Q3 often involves determinant/inverse computations

## Computational Complexity
- Requires systematic organization to avoid errors
- Multiple algebraic steps requiring careful attention
- Good test of computational accuracy under exam conditions

## Learning Value
- Reinforces determinant calculation techniques
- Tests understanding of invertibility conditions
- Requires mastery of adjugate method
- Builds confidence in symbolic manipulation
