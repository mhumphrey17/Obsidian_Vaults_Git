# 2021-Q01-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapters**: Multiple (Ch1, Ch2, Ch3, Ch5)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - (a) Basis characterization
  - (b) Similar matrices properties
  - (c) Determinant properties
  - (d) Equivalent vs. similar matrices
  - (e) Diagonalizability conditions
  - (f) Self-adjoint and normal operators
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-1.4.2 (Basis)
  - DEF-1.7.9 (Similar/Equivalent Matrices)
  - THM-2.3.3 (Determinant Product Formula)
  - DEF-3.3.1 (Diagonalization)
  - THM-3.4.7 (Diagonalizability Characterization)
  - DEF-5.1.6 (Self-adjoint)
  - DEF-5.2.5 (Normal Operator)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Recall/Understanding (True/False)
- **Difficulty Level**: Easy
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Key definitions and their relationships
  - Basic properties of matrices and operators
  - Understanding of terminology differences

## Solution Strategy
- Direct application of definitions and standard theorems
- Pattern recognition for standard true/false questions

## Potential Pitfalls
- (a): Terminology ambiguity with "maximal spanning"
- (d): Confusing equivalent and similar matrices
- (e): Not recognizing standard diagonalizability criterion
- Overall: Needs careful attention to precise definitions

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Covers fundamental concepts from all chapters
- **Problem Sheets**: Similar true/false questions likely in early weeks
- **Other Past Papers**: Consistent format with 2022-Q01 and 2023-Q01

## Question Quality Assessment
- Excellent coverage of diverse concepts
- Tests fundamental understanding
- Good mix of straightforward and subtle distinctions
- Appropriate as opening question for building confidence
