# 2021-Q07: Inner Products and Orthonormal Basis

## Question Statement
(a) Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Define what it means for the map $V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{F},(v, w) \mapsto\langle v, w\rangle$, to be an inner product on $V$. [14]

(b) Let $V$ be an inner product space and $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ a linear operator. Show that $\phi$ is self-adjoint if and only if $i \phi$ is skew-adjoint, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$.

(c) Let $V=\{f \in \mathbb{R}[x]: \operatorname{deg} f \leq 2\}$. For any $f, g \in V$, define
$$\langle f, g\rangle=f(-1) g(-1)+f(0) g(0)+f(1) g(1)$$
(i) Show that $\langle$,$\rangle defines an inner product on V$.
(ii) Show that the polynomials
$$f_{1}=\frac{(x+1) x}{2}, \quad f_{2}=\frac{x(x-1)}{2}, \quad f_{3}=(x-1)(x+1)$$
form an orthonormal basis of $V$.
