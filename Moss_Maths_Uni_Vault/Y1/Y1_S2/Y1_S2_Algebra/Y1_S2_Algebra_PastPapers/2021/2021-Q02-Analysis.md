# 2021-Q02-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps and Bases)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Subspace definition
  - Subspace test (closure properties)
- **Item Mapping**: DEF-1.2.6 (Linear Subspace)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Recall + Application/Justification
- **Difficulty Level**: Standard
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Definition of linear subspace
  - How to test subspace properties
  - Working with complex numbers and algebraic manipulation

## Solution Strategy
1. State the definition clearly
2. Understand the defining condition $(x+y)(x-y) = 0$
3. Construct counterexample for closure
4. Properly justify the conclusion

## Potential Pitfalls
- Not properly simplifying the algebraic condition
- Failing to find a clear counterexample
- Not checking all closure properties (though one counterexample is sufficient)
- Arithmetic errors in verification

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Chapter 1, sections on subspaces
- **Problem Sheets**: Likely similar subspace tests in early weeks
- **Other Past Papers**: Similar format in Q2 across multiple years

## Key Learning Objectives Tested
1. Ability to recall and state definitions precisely
2. Algebraic manipulation skills
3. Construction of counterexamples
4. Logical reasoning and justification

## Pedagogical Value
- Reinforces fundamental concept of subspaces
- Tests understanding of closure properties
- Requires both theoretical knowledge and computational skills
- Good example of how algebraic conditions can exclude subspace structure
