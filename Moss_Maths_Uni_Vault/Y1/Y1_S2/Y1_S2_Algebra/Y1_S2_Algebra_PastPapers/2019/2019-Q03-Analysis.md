# 2019-Q03-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Matrix inverse computation
  - Invertibility conditions
  - Gaussian elimination
  - Special matrix types
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - COR-2.2.4 (Determinant and Invertibility)
  - COR-2.4.7 (Inverse using Adjugate)
  - Algorithm for Gaussian elimination

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Calculation/Application
- **Difficulty Level**: 
  - Part (a): Easy (standard 2×2)
  - Part (b): Easy (recognition of non-square)
  - Part (c): Standard (systematic computation)
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - 2×2 inverse formula
  - Gaussian elimination procedure
  - Conditions for invertibility

## Solution Strategy
1. Check dimensions and invertibility conditions
2. Apply appropriate method based on matrix size:
   - 2×2: Direct formula
   - Non-square: Explain non-invertibility
   - Larger square: Gaussian elimination
3. Verify results through calculation

## Potential Pitfalls
- Arithmetic errors in row operations
- Not checking determinant first
- Mixing up row/column operations
- Missing sign changes in permutation matrices

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Matrix operations (Week 3-4)
- **Problem Sheets**: Week 3-4 inverse calculations
- **Other Past Papers**: Similar calculations appear in multiple years
