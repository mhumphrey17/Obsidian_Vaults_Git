# 2019-Q02-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces, Linear Maps and Bases)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Linear systems analysis
  - Gaussian elimination
  - Rank and consistency
  - Solution types
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - PROP-1.4.10 (Gaussian Elimination for consistency)
  - DEF-1.8.1 (Rank)
  - THM-1.9.2 (Rank-Nullity Theorem indirectly)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Application/Calculation
- **Difficulty Level**: Standard
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Gaussian elimination procedure
  - Rank conditions for different solution types
  - Algebraic manipulation with parameters

## Solution Strategy
1. Form augmented matrix
2. Row reduce systematically
3. Analyze the reduced form for different values of parameter
4. Apply rank conditions to determine solution types
5. Solve explicitly for unique solution case

## Potential Pitfalls
- Arithmetic errors during row operations
- Missing one of the conditions for no solution
- Errors in solving parametric equations
- Confusion between rank of coefficient matrix vs augmented matrix

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Systems of linear equations (Week 2-3)
- **Problem Sheets**: Week 1-2 linear systems
- **Other Past Papers**: Similar parametric system analysis appears in multiple years
