# 2019-Q06: Linear Maps and Anti-symmetric Matrices

## Question Statement

(a) Suppose that $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{11} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{4}$ is a linear map such that the image of $\phi$ equals the span of the vectors
$$
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\ -2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 5 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ 8 \\ 1 \\ 7 \end{pmatrix}
$$
What is the dimension of the kernel of $\phi$? Explain your reasoning, and provide clear statements of any results from the course that you use. [8]

(b) Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field. Recall that $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ is anti-symmetric if $A^{T}=-A$.

(i) Show that if $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ is invertible then $\operatorname{det} A \neq 0$.

(ii) Show that if $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ is anti-symmetric then $\operatorname{det} A=(-1)^{n} \operatorname{det} A$, stating clearly any result from the course that you use.

(iii) Is there an anti-symmetric $A \in M_{3,3}(\mathbb{R})$ that is invertible? Give an example, or show that none exists.
