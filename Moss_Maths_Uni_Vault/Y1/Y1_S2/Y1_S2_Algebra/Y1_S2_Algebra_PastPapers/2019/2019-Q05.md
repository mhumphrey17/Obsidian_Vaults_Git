# 2019-Q05: Diagonalisability Examples

## Question Statement
(a) Give an example of a matrix $A \in M_{2,2}(\mathbb{R})$ that is diagonalisable over $\mathbb{C}$, but not over $\mathbb{R}$.

(b) Give an example of a matrix $B \in M_{2,2}(\mathbb{C})$ that is not diagonalisable over $\mathbb{C}$.

Briefly justify why your examples have the claimed properties. [6]

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Diagonalisability]]: Conditions for diagonalisability over different fields
- [[Eigenvalues]]: Real vs complex eigenvalues
- [[Geometric multiplicity]]: Dimension of eigenspaces
- [[Algebraic multiplicity]]: Multiplicity of eigenvalues in characteristic polynomial
- [[Real vs Complex fields]]: How field choice affects diagonalisability
