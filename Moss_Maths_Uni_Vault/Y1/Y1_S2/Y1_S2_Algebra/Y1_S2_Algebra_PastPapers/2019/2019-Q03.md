# 2019-Q03: Matrix Inverses

## Question Statement
For each of the following matrices with real entries:

(a) $\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$

(b) $\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 7 & -4 & 2 \\ 9 & -8 & 2 & -1 \\ -1 & 3 & 7 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$

(c) $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$

either explain why the matrix is not invertible or write down its inverse.
