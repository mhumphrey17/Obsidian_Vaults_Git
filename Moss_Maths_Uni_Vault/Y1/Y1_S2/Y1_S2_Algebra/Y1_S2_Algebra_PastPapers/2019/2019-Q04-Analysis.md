# 2019-Q04-Analysis: Detailed Question Analysis

## Topic Mapping
- **Primary Chapter**: Chapter 2 (Determinants and Inverses)
- **Primary Concepts**: 
  - Determinant computation
  - Row operations preserving determinant
  - Cofactor expansion
  - Properties of determinants
- **Item Mapping**: 
  - DEF-2.1.1 (Determinant)
  - PROP-2.2.3 (Effect of EROs on determinant)
  - PROP-2.4.2 (Cofactor expansion)
  - PROP-2.2.1 (Properties - identical rows/columns)

## Skill Assessment
- **Task Type**: Calculation/Application
- **Difficulty Level**: 
  - Part (a): Standard (systematic 4Ã—4 computation)
  - Part (b): Easy (property recognition)
- **Required Knowledge**: 
  - Row operations and their effect on determinants
  - Cofactor expansion technique
  - Fundamental properties of determinants

## Solution Strategy
1. Part (a): Use row operations to simplify, then expand
2. Part (b): Look for special structure before computing

## Potential Pitfalls
- Not recognizing identical columns in part (b)
- Arithmetic errors in row operations
- Sign errors in cofactor expansion
- Not exploiting structure efficiently

## Connections to Course Material
- **Lecture Notes**: Determinant properties (Week 4-5)
- **Problem Sheets**: Week 4-5 determinant calculations
- **Other Past Papers**: Similar computational problems in multiple years
