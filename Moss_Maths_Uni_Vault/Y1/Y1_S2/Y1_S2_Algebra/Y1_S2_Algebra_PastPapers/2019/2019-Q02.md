# 2019-Q02: Parametric Linear Systems

## Question Statement
For each fixed $t \in \mathbb{R}$, consider the linear system
$$
\begin{aligned}
x-y+3 z & =2 \\
-3 x+5 y-5 z & =-6 \\
2 x+3 y+t^{2} z & =t
\end{aligned}
$$

For which values of $t \in \mathbb{R}$ does the system have:
(a) no solution?
(b) a unique solution?
(c) infinitely many solutions?

In case (b), write down the unique solution $(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ in terms of $t$.
