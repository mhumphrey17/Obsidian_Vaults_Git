# 2019-Q07: Trace Properties and Eigenvalue Analysis

## Question Statement

**Part (a)**: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and square matrix $A = (A_{ij}) \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$, define the trace as $\operatorname{tr} A = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{ii}$.

(i) Show that if $A, B \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ then $\operatorname{tr}(AB) = \operatorname{tr}(BA)$

(ii) Define what it means for two matrices $X, Y \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ to be similar.

(iii) Show that if $X$ and $Y \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ are similar, then $\operatorname{tr} X = \operatorname{tr} Y$

(iv) Show that if $C \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{C})$ then the trace of $C$ equals the sum of the eigenvalues of $C$, counted with their arithmetic multiplicities.

**Part (b)**: Let $C = \begin{pmatrix}
10 & -6 & -3 & -9 & 6 \\
-2 & 11 & 2 & 6 & -4 \\
1 & -2 & 6 & -3 & 2 \\
4 & -8 & -4 & -5 & 8 \\
1 & -2 & -1 & -3 & 9
\end{pmatrix} \in M_{5,5}(\mathbb{C})$

(i) Show that 7 is an eigenvalue of $C$, and compute its geometric multiplicity.

(ii) Find all other eigenvalues of $C$ and their geometric multiplicities.

(iii) Is $C$ diagonalisable? Justify your answer.
