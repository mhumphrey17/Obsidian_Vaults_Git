# 2019-Q01: True/False Questions on Fundamental Concepts

## Question Statement
Are the following true or false? (No justification needed for Question 1)

(a) A basis of a vector space never contains the zero vector.
(b) Equivalent matrices have equal rank.
(c) Any $n \times n$ matrix with $n$ distinct eigenvalues is diagonalisable.
(d) If $V$ is a linear subspace of a vector space $W$, then its complement $W \backslash V$ is not a linear subspace of $W$.
(e) If two square matrices are equivalent, then they have the same eigenvalues.
(f) If $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{C})$ then $A$ has at least one eigenvalue.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Basis]]: Part (a) requires understanding the definition of a basis as a linearly independent spanning set
- [[Equivalent matrices]]: Parts (b) and (e) deal with properties of equivalent matrices

- [[Diagonalisability]]: Part (c) relates to the condition for diagonalisability
- [[Subspace]]: Part (d) involves properties of vector subspaces
- [[Complex matrices]]: Part (f) deals with eigenvalues of complex matrices
