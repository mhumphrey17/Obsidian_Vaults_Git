# 2022-Q06: Rank, Nullity, and Matrix Representation

## Question

### Part (a) [8 marks]
Let $\phi : V \to W$ be a linear map.

#### (i) [4 marks]
Define the rank of $\phi$ and the nullity of $\phi$, and state the Rank-Nullity Theorem.

#### (ii) [4 marks]
State conditions, in terms of rank $\phi$, for $\phi$ to be injective and for $\phi$ to be surjective. Give brief justifications for each.

### Part (b) [7 marks]
Let $e_1, e_2, e_3$ be the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\psi : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be the linear operator defined by:
$$\psi(e_1) = e_1 + e_2 + e_3, \quad \psi(e_2) = e_1 + e_2 - e_3, \quad \psi(e_3) = -e_1 - e_2 + e_3$$

#### (i)
Compute the matrix representing $\psi$ with respect to the basis $e_1 + e_2, e_1 + e_2 + e_3, e_2 + e_3$.

#### (ii)
Is $\psi$ invertible? Briefly justify your answer.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a)
- [[Rank]]: $\text{rank}(\phi) = \dim(\text{Im}(\phi))$
- [[Nullity]]: $\text{null}(\phi) = \dim(\text{Ker}(\phi))$
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: $\dim V = \text{rank}(\phi) + \text{null}(\phi)$
- [[Injective]]: $\phi$ is injective iff $\text{Ker}(\phi) = \{0\}$
- [[Surjective]]: $\phi$ is surjective iff $\text{Im}(\phi) = W$

### Part (b)
- [[Matrix Representation]]: Standard basis representation
- [[Change of Basis]]: Using change of basis matrix
- [[Change of Basis Matrix]]: Columns are new basis vectors in standard coordinates
- [[Gaussian Elimination]]: For finding matrix inverses
- [[Invertible Matrix]]: Nonzero determinant condition

## Approach

### Part (a)
1. State definitions precisely with dimension notation
2. State RNT with correct formula
3. Express injectivity/surjectivity in terms of rank
4. Provide brief justifications using RNT

### Part (b)
1. Find matrix A representing $\psi$ in standard basis
2. Find change of basis matrix P from standard to new basis
3. Compute $P^{-1}$ (using Gaussian elimination)
4. Calculate $B = P^{-1}AP$
5. Check invertibility using determinant or rank
