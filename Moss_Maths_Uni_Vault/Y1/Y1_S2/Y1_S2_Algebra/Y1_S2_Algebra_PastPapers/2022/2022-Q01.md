# 2022-Q01: True/False Statements

## Question
Are the following true or false? (No justification required)

### Part (a)
Let U and W be linear subspaces of V with bases $u_1, \ldots, u_s$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_t$, respectively. Then the concatenated list $u_1, \ldots, u_s, w_1, \ldots, w_t$ is a basis of $U + W$.

### Part (b)
Similar matrices have the same rank.

### Part (c)
A matrix representing a linear map is square.

### Part (d)
Let $A$ be a square matrix such that $A^2 = 0$. Then $\det A = 0$.

### Part (e)
Let $v$ and $w$ be linearly independent $\lambda$-eigenvectors of $\phi : V \to V$. Then for any nonzero scalars $\mu$ and $\gamma$, $\mu v + \gamma w$ is again a $\lambda$-eigenvector of $\phi$.

### Part (f)
Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix over $\mathbb{C}$. If $A$ has fewer than $n$ distinct eigenvalues, then $A$ is not diagonalisable.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Bases and Subspace Sum
- [[Linear Subspace]]: Definition of linear subspaces U and W
- [[Basis]]: Definition of basis for a subspace
- [[Sum of Subspaces]]: Properties of $U + W$
- [[Direct Sum]]: Connection to when concatenated basis works

### Part (b) - Similar Matrices
- [[Similar Matrices]]: Definition and properties
- [[Rank]]: Definition and invariance properties

### Part (c) - Matrix Representation
- [[Matrix Representation]]: When linear maps have square matrices
- [[Linear Map]]: Domain and codomain dimensions

### Part (d) - Determinants
- [[Determinant]]: Properties of determinants
- [[Nilpotent Matrix]]: Matrices with $A^2 = 0$
- [[Product Formula]]: $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$

### Part (e) - Eigenvectors
- [[Eigenvalue/Eigenvector]]: Definition
- [[Eigenspace]]: Linear combinations of eigenvectors
- [[Linear Independence]]: Property of eigenvectors

### Part (f) - Diagonalisation
- [[Diagonalisation]]: Conditions for diagonalisability
- [[Algebraic Multiplicity]]: vs [[Geometric Multiplicity]]
- [[Distinct Eigenvalues]]: Sufficient condition for diagonalisability

## Approach
1. Test each statement against fundamental definitions and properties
2. For part (a): Consider whether concatenation requires additional conditions
3. For part (b): Use invariance of rank under similarity
4. For part (c): Consider dimensions of domain and codomain
5. For part (d): Apply determinant properties to $A^2 = 0$
6. For part (e): Use properties of eigenspaces
7. For part (f): Consider counterexamples with repeated eigenvalues

## Notes
- This is a conceptual question testing understanding of fundamental properties
- No calculations required - focus on definitions and key theorems
- Each part tests a different chapter concept
- Some parts require distinguishing sufficient vs necessary conditions
