# 2022-Q07: Orthonormal Bases and Adjoint Operators

## Question

### Part (a) [8 marks]

#### (i)
Let $V$ be an inner product space. Define what it means for a basis of $V$ to be orthonormal.

#### (ii)
Let $A \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{R})$ be an invertible matrix. Describe what it means for the product $A = QR$ to be the QR decomposition of $A$.

#### (iii)
Apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation to the basis
$$v_1 = (1, 1), \quad v_2 = (1,2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$$
to obtain an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and write down the QR decomposition of the matrix $A$ with column vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$, respectively.

### Part (b) [7 marks]
Let $V$ be an inner product space and let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be linear operators defined on $V$.

#### (i)
Define what it means for a linear operator $\phi^* : V \to V$ to be the adjoint of $\phi$.

#### (ii)
Show that $(\phi\psi)^* = \psi^*\phi^*$ and $(\phi^*)^* = \phi$.

(You may assume without proof that the adjoint of a linear operator is unique.)

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a)
- [[Orthonormal Basis]]: $\langle v_i, v_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
- [[QR Decomposition]]: $A = QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal, $R$ is upper triangular
- [[Gram-Schmidt Process]]: Orthogonalization algorithm
- [[Orthogonal Matrix]]: $Q^TQ = I$

### Part (b)
- [[Adjoint Operator]]: $\langle \phi(v), w \rangle = \langle v, \phi^*(w) \rangle$
- [[Linear Operator Properties]]: Composition and double adjoint
- [[Inner Product Properties]]: Used in proof construction

## Approach

### Part (a)
1. State orthonormal definition with inner product notation
2. Define QR decomposition properties precisely
3. Apply Gram-Schmidt step by step
4. Construct Q and R matrices from orthonormal basis

### Part (b)
1. State adjoint definition using inner product
2. Prove both identities using definition and inner product properties
3. Use uniqueness of adjoint to conclude equalities

## Notes
- Part (a)(iii) requires careful calculation in Gram-Schmidt
- Part (b) requires formal proof construction
- Both parts involve significant theoretical understanding
