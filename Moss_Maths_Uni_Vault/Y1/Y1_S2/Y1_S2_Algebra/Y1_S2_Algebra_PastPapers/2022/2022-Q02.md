# 2022-Q02: Linear Maps

## Question

### Part (a)
Define what it means for a map $\phi : V \to W$ to be linear.

### Part (b)
Are the following maps linear? Briefly justify your answer.

#### (i)
$f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}, x \mapsto x + 100$.

#### (ii)
$f : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}, (x,y) \mapsto xy$.

## Key Concepts Involved

### Part (a) - Linear Map Definition
- [[Linear Map]]: Fundamental definition with two properties
- [[Additivity]]: $\phi(v + w) = \phi(v) + \phi(w)$
- [[Homogeneity]]: $\phi(\lambda v) = \lambda \phi(v)$
- Equivalent combined form: $\phi(v + \lambda w) = \phi(v) + \lambda \phi(w)$

### Part (b) - Testing for Linearity
- [[Zero Vector Property]]: $\phi(0) = 0$ for any linear map
- [[Additivity]]: Testing with specific vectors
- [[Homogeneity]]: Testing with scalar multiplication

## Approach

### Part (a)
State the definition using either:
1. Two separate properties (additivity and homogeneity)
2. Combined property form
3. Ensure all quantifiers are included

### Part (b)
For each function:
1. Test a property that's easy to verify (often $f(0) = 0$)
2. If that fails, provide a counterexample
3. If it passes, test additivity or homogeneity with specific values

## Solution
See [[2022-Q02-Solution]]

## Notes
- Part (a) is pure recall - no calculation required
- Part (b) requires finding counterexamples to linearity
- Common strategy: test $f(0) = 0$ first as it's often the quickest check
