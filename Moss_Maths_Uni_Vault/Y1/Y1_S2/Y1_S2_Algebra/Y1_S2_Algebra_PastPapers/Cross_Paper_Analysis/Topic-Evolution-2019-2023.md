--------|------|------|------|------|------|-------
2019    | 45%  | 25%  | 30%  |  0%  |  0%  | 100%
2020    | 45%  | 25%  | 30%  |  0%  |  0%  | 100%
2021    | 40%  | 20%  | 20%  | 15%  |  5%  | 100%
2022    | 40%  | 15%  | 20%  | 15%  | 10%  | 100%
2023    | 40%  | 15%  | 20%  | 15%  | 10%  | 100%
```

**Key Observation**: Clear transition in 2021 from 3-chapter focus to 5-chapter coverage

**Trend**: Overall difficulty has increased since 2021, particularly in Q2 and Q4

## Strategic Topic Priorities by Year

### Pre-2021 Strategy (Chapters 1-3 Focus)
1. Master vector space fundamentals
2. Perfect determinant calculations
3. Understand eigenvalue theory
4. Practice diagonalisation extensively

### Post-2021 Strategy (All Chapters)
1. Maintain strong Ch1-3 foundation
2. Add inner product calculations
3. Learn Gram-Schmidt systematically
4. Understand adjoint properties
5. Practice orthogonal diagonalisation

## Question Recycling Patterns

### Repeated Questions
- **Q6 (2020-2021)**: Identical Rank-Nullity application
- **Trace Properties**: Similar approaches in Q7 (2019-2020)
- **Subspace Testing**: Consistent format in True/False

### Evolving Questions
- **Diagonalisation**: Increasingly complex from simple examples to spectral theorem
- **Linear Maps**: From basic testing to change of basis and representations
- **Proofs**: More sophisticated techniques required in recent years

## Prediction Model

### Highly Likely (>90% probability)
1. True/False section covering all syllabus
2. Rank-Nullity Theorem application
3. Determinant calculation with properties
4. Eigenvalue/eigenvector computation
5. Diagonalisability analysis

### Probable (70-90% probability)
1. Inner product space problem
2. Gram-Schmidt or orthonormalization
3. Linear map with non-standard bases
4. Proof involving matrix properties
5. Adjoint-related question

### Possible (50-70% probability)
