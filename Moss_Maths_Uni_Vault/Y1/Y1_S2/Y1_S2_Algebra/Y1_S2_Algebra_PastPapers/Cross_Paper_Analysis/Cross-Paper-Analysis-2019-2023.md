# MATH202 Algebra: Cross-Paper Analysis (2019-2023)

## Introduction
This analysis synthesizes patterns across five years of MATH202 Algebra exam papers (2019-2023), identifying consistent themes, evolving content, and strategic preparation insights.

## Topic Frequency Analysis

### Consistent Core (All Years)
**Chapter 1: Vector Spaces, Linear Maps, and Bases** - **40-50%** of marks
- [[Basis]]es, [[linear independence]], dimension
- [[Linear maps]], matrix representation
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]] applications

**Chapter 2: Determinants and Inverses** - **15-25%** of marks
- Determinant computation and properties
- Matrix invertibility and inverse calculation
- Adjugate formula applications

**Chapter 3: Eigenvalues and Diagonalisation** - **15-25%** of marks
- Eigenvalue/eigenvector calculations
- Diagonalisability criteria (real vs complex)
- Geometric vs algebraic multiplicities

### Evolving Content
**Chapters 4-5: Inner Product Spaces and Linear Operators** 
- **2019-2020**: Largely absent
- **2021-2023**: Regular presence (15-25%)
- Trend indicates stabilization as core content

## Most Frequently Tested Items

### Guaranteed Appearances ("Banker" Topics)
1. **Q1 True/False section** (6 marks)
2. **Rank-Nullity Theorem** (statement and application)
3. **Basis definition** and related calculations
