# PS02-Q03: Basis and Coordinates in Polynomial Space

## Problem Statement

Let $V \leq \mathbb{R}[X]$ be the subspace of polynomials of degree $\leq 3$ and let $\alpha$ be the following list:

$$p_0 = 1, \quad p_1 = X-1, \quad p_2 = X^2-X+1, \quad p_3 = X^3-X^2+X-1$$

(i) Show that the list $\alpha$ is a basis of $V$.

(ii) Compute the coordinate vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^4$ of $X^3-X^2$ with respect to $\alpha$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Polynomial Space]]: The vector space of polynomials with real coefficients
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set that provides unique coordinate representations
- [[Coordinate Vector]]: The unique representation of a vector with respect to a specific basis
- [[Dimension]]: The polynomial space of degree â‰¤ 3 has dimension 4

## Approach

1. To show $\alpha$ is a basis, prove it's both linearly independent and spanning
2. Since $\dim(V) = 4$ and we have 4 polynomials, we only need to verify one property (typically independence)
3. For coordinates, express $X^3-X^2$ as a linear combination of the basis polynomials
4. Solve the resulting system of equations by comparing coefficients
