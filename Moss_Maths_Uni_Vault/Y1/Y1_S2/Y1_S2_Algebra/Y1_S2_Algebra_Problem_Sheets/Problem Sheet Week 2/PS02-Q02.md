# PS02-Q02: Linear Independence and Coordinates in Function Space

## Problem Statement

Let $V$ be the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ spanned by $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$. 

(a) Show that $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$ are linearly independent.

(b) Compute the coordinate vector representing $h = \cosh(x)$ with respect to the basis $e^x, e^{-x}$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Function Space]]: The vector space $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{R}}$ of all functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$
- [[Linear Independence]]: Functions are linearly independent if no non-trivial linear combination equals the zero function
- [[Coordinate Vector]]: Representation of a vector with respect to a specific basis
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set that provides unique coordinates
- [[Exponential Functions]]: $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$ as vectors in function space

## Approach

1. To prove linear independence, assume $\lambda e^x + \mu e^{-x} = 0$ (the zero function) and show this implies $\lambda = \mu = 0$
2. Evaluate the equation at strategically chosen points to get a system of equations
3. For the coordinate vector, use the definition of $\cosh(x)$ and express it as a linear combination of $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$
