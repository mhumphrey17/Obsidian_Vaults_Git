# PS02-Q04: Linear Independence, Spanning, and Basis in R^3 (with Zero Vector)

## Problem Statement

Let $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_5$ be the same as in Q1. Which of the following lists of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ are linearly independent? Which are spanning? Which are bases?

(i) $\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_5$

(ii) $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_3, \mathbf{v}_4, \mathbf{v}_5$

(iii) $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \mathbf{v}_3$

Where the vectors are:
$$
\mathbf{v}_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
2 \\
5
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
3 \\
5
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{4}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
2 \\
3 \\
4
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{5}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
3 \\
4 \\
5
\end{array}\right)
$$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Zero Vector]]: The additive identity in a vector space; always causes linear dependence when included in a list
- [[Linear Independence]]: A property that is automatically violated by the presence of the zero vector
- [[Spanning Set]]: The zero vector doesn't add to the span of a list
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set

## Approach

1. Remember that any list containing the zero vector is linearly dependent
2. For other lists, use the results from Q1 or apply Gaussian elimination
3. Check both linear independence and spanning properties
4. A basis requires both properties in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with exactly 3 vectors

## Solution

See [[PS02-Q04-Solution]]
