# PS02-Q01: Linear Independence and Spanning in R^3

## Problem Statement

Let
$$
\mathbf{v}_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
2 \\
3
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
2 \\
5
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
1 \\
3 \\
5
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{4}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
2 \\
3 \\
4
\end{array}\right), \quad \mathbf{v}_{5}=\left(\begin{array}{l}
3 \\
4 \\
5
\end{array}\right)
$$

Which of the following lists of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are linearly independent? Which are spanning?

(i) $\mathbf{v}_{2}, \mathbf{v}_{5}$ 

(ii) $\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}, \mathbf{v}_{3}, \mathbf{v}_{4}$ 

(iii) $\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{4}, \mathbf{v}_{5}$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Linear Independence]]: A list of vectors is linearly independent if no vector can be written as a linear combination of the others
- [[Spanning Set]]: A set of vectors spans a space if every vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in the set
- [[Gaussian Elimination]]: Tool for determining linear independence and spanning properties by reducing matrices to row echelon form
- [[Rank]]: The number of linearly independent rows/columns in a matrix, which determines both independence and spanning properties

## Approach

1. To check linear independence, set up a matrix with the given vectors as columns and perform Gaussian elimination
2. If the matrix has a pivot in every column, the vectors are linearly independent
3. To check spanning, examine whether the matrix has a pivot in every row
4. For $\mathbb{R}^3$, we need exactly 3 linearly independent vectors to span the space
