# PS02-Q05: Linear Maps and Spanning/Linear Independence

## Problem Statement

Let $\phi: V \rightarrow W$ be a linear map and suppose $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in V$.

(i) If $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ span $V$ and $\phi$ is surjective, show that $\phi(v_1), \ldots, \phi(v_n)$ span $W$.

(ii) If $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ are linearly independent and $\phi$ is injective, show that $\phi(v_1), \ldots, \phi(v_n)$ are linearly independent.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Linear Maps]]: Functions between vector spaces that preserve linear combinations
- [[Surjective]]: A map where every element of the codomain is in the image (range)
- [[Injective]]: A map where different inputs give different outputs (one-to-one)
- [[Kernel]]: The set of vectors mapped to zero by a linear map
- [[Linear Independence]]: Vectors with only the trivial dependence relation
- [[Spanning]]: Vectors whose linear combinations generate the entire space

## Approach

1. For surjectivity: Use the fact that every element in $W$ has a preimage in $V$
2. For injectivity: Use the characterization of injective linear maps via the kernel
3. Apply the linearity of $\phi$ to convert statements about $V$ to statements about $W$
