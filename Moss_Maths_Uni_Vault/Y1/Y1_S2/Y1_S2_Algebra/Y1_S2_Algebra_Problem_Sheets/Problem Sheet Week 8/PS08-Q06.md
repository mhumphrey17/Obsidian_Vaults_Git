# PS08-Q06: Inner Product Space Identities (Pythagoras, Parallelogram)

## Problem Statement
Let $V$ be an inner product space and $v, w \in V$.

(i) Prove the Pythagoras theorem: if $v \perp w$ then $\|v + w\|^2 = \|v\|^2 + \|w\|^2$.

(ii) Prove the parallelogram identity: $\|v + w\|^2 + \|v - w\|^2 = 2(\|v\|^2 + \|w\|^2)$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Pythagoras Theorem]]: Fundamental identity for orthogonal vectors
- [[Parallelogram Identity]]: Identity that characterizes inner product spaces
- [[Inner Product Space]]: Vector space with compatible inner product
- [[Conjugate Symmetry]]: $\langle w, v \rangle = \overline{\langle v, w \rangle}$
- [[Norm]]: Induced by inner product as $\|v\|^2 = \langle v, v \rangle$

## Approach
1. Express norm squared in terms of inner product: $\|v\|^2 = \langle v, v \rangle$
2. Expand $\|v + w\|^2$ and $\|v - w\|^2$ using linearity and conjugate symmetry
3. For part (i): Use orthogonality condition $\langle v, w \rangle = 0$
4. For part (ii): Add the two expanded expressions and simplify
