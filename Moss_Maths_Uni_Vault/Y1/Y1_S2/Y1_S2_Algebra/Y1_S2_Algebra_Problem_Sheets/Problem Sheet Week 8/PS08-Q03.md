# PS08-Q03: Properties of Roots of Unity

## Problem Statement
For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, an $n$-th root of unity is $\omega \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\omega^n = 1$. Prove:

(i) $|\omega| = 1$, for any $n$-th root of unity $\omega$.

(ii) If $\omega_1, \omega_2$ are $n$-th roots of unity then so is $\omega_1 \omega_2$ and $\omega_1^{-1}$.

(iii) If $\omega$ is an $n$-th root of unity and $\omega \neq 1$,
$$1 + \omega + \cdots + \omega^{n-1} = 0$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Complex Number]]: Numbers of the form $a + bi$
- [[Roots of Unity]]: Complex numbers satisfying $\omega^n = 1$
- [[Complex Modulus]]: $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ for $z = a + bi$
- Group properties of roots of unity
- [[Geometric Series]]: Sum formula for finite geometric sequences

## Approach
1. For (i): Use properties of modulus and the equation $\omega^n = 1$
2. For (ii): Verify group properties by direct computation
3. For (iii): Use the polynomial factorization $x^n - 1 = (x-1)(1 + x + \cdots + x^{n-1})$
