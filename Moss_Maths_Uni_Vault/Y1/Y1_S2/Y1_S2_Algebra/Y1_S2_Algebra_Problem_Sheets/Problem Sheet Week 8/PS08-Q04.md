# PS08-Q04: Eigenvalues, Multiplicities, Diagonalisation, and P Matrix (More Examples)

## Problem Statement
Find the eigenvalues of the following matrices and their algebraic and geometric multiplicities. In each case, say whether the matrix is diagonalisable (and why). If it is diagonalisable, find an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP$ is diagonal.

$$\text{(i) } A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
3 & 1 & -1 \\
-1 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 2
\end{array}\right) \quad \text{(ii) } A = \left(\begin{array}{lll}
4 & 0 & 1 \\
2 & 3 & 2 \\
1 & 0 & 4
\end{array}\right)$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Scalars λ such that Av = λv for some non-zero v
- [[Algebraic Multiplicity]]: Multiplicity of λ as root of characteristic polynomial
- [[Geometric Multiplicity]]: Dimension of eigenspace corresponding to λ
- [[Diagonalisable Matrix]]: Matrix similar to diagonal matrix via P^{-1}AP
- [[Change of Basis Matrix]]: Matrix P whose columns are eigenvectors
- [[Diagonalizability Criterion]]: a.m.(λ) = g.m.(λ) for all eigenvalues

## Approach
1. Compute characteristic polynomial and find eigenvalues
2. Determine algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue
3. Find eigenspaces by solving (A-λI)v = 0
4. Determine geometric multiplicity by finding dimension of eigenspaces
5. Check if a.m.(λ) = g.m.(λ) for all eigenvalues
6. If diagonalisable, construct P using eigenvectors as columns
