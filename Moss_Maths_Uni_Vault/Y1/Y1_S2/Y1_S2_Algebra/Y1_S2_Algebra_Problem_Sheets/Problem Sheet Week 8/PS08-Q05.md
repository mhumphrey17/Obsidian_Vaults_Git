# PS08-Q05: Orthonormality of Roots of Unity Vectors

## Problem Statement
Let $\omega_k := e^{2\pi i k/n}$, $0 \leq k \leq n-1$, be the $n$-th roots of unity and define $v_k \in \mathbb{C}^n$ by

$$v_k = \left(1, \omega_k, \ldots, \omega_k^{n-1}\right) / \sqrt{n}$$

for $0 \leq k \leq n-1$.

Prove that $v_0, \ldots, v_{n-1}$ are orthonormal for the dot product.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Orthonormal List]]: Vectors that are pairwise orthogonal and unit length
- [[Inner Product]]: Complex inner product with conjugate linearity
- [[Roots of Unity]]: Complex numbers satisfying $\omega^n = 1$
- [[Conjugate Symmetry]]: Property of complex inner products
- Geometric series summation

## Approach
1. Show that each $v_k$ has unit norm: $\langle v_k, v_k \rangle = 1$
2. Show that distinct vectors are orthogonal: $\langle v_j, v_k \rangle = 0$ for $j \neq k$
3. Use properties of roots of unity, particularly the sum formula from Q3
4. Apply the normalization factor $1/\sqrt{n}$

## Solution
See [[PS08-Q05-Solution]]
