# PS08-Q07: Characteristic Polynomial from a Cyclic Vector

## Problem Statement
Let $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ be a linear operator, and suppose that there is some $v \in V$ such that $v, \phi(v), \ldots, \phi^{n-1}(v)$ is a basis of $V$. Let $\mathbf{a} = (a_i) \in \mathbb{F}^n$ be the coordinate vector that represents $-\phi^n(v)$ with respect to this basis, i.e.

$$-\phi^n(v) = a_1 v + a_2 \phi(v) + \cdots + a_n \phi^{n-1}(v)$$

Show that the characteristic polynomial of $\phi$ is

$$(-1)^n(t^n + a_n t^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1)$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Characteristic Polynomial]]: $\Delta_\phi(t) = \det(\phi - t\text{id}_V)$
- [[Linear Operator]]: Linear map from vector space to itself
- [[Matrix Representation]]: Matrix with respect to a chosen basis
- Cyclic vector: Vector generating a basis via repeated application of operator
- [[Companion Matrix]]: Special matrix form associated with polynomial relations
- [[Change of Basis Matrix]]: Relates representations in different bases

## Approach
1. Identify the basis given by powers of $\phi$ applied to $v$
2. Construct the matrix representation of $\phi$ with respect to this basis
3. Recognize the companion matrix structure
4. Compute the characteristic polynomial using matrix properties
5. Use induction or determinant expansion techniques
