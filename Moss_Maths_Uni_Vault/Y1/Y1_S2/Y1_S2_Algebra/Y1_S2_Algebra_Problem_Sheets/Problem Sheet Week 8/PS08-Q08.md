# PS08-Q08: Constructing a Matrix with a Given Characteristic Polynomial

## Problem Statement
For any degree $n$ polynomial $f(t) \in \mathbb{F}[t]$ with the coefficient of the leading term (i.e. the $t^n$ term) $(-1)^n$, find a matrix $A \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ such that

$$\Delta_A(t) = f(t)$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Characteristic Polynomial]]: $\Delta_A(t) = \det(A - tI)$
- [[Matrix Representation]]: Explicit matrix construction
- [[Companion Matrix]]: Matrix encoding polynomial coefficients
- Polynomial realization problem
- Relationship between polynomials and matrices

## Approach
1. Write the polynomial in standard form: $f(t) = (-1)^n(t^n + a_n t^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1)$
2. Use the result from Q7 in reverse
3. Construct the companion matrix corresponding to the polynomial
4. Verify that this matrix has the desired characteristic polynomial

## Solution
