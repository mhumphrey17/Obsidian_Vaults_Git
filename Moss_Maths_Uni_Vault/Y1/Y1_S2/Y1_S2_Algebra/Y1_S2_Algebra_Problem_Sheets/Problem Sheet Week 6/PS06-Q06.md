# PS06-Q06: Determinant of Sum Counterexample

## Problem Statement
Construct two matrices $A, B \in M_{2,2}(\mathbb{F})$ such that

$$\operatorname{det}(A+B) \neq \operatorname{det} A+\operatorname{det} B$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value assigned to square matrices
- [[Matrix Addition]]: Element-wise addition of matrices
- [[Multilinearity of Determinants]]: Determinant is linear in each row/column separately
- [[Counterexample]]: Specific instance that disproves a general statement

## Approach
1. Find simple matrices where the determinant calculation is easy
2. Verify that the proposed equation fails
3. Understand why determinants are not linear with respect to matrix addition

## Solution
See [[PS06-Q06-Solution]]
