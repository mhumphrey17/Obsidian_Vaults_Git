# PS06-Q07: Characteristic Polynomial, Trace, and Determinant for 2x2

## Problem Statement
Consider a general $2 \times 2$ matrix $A=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22}\end{array}\right)$.

(i) Let $\operatorname{tr} A=a_{11}+a_{22}$ (called the trace of $A$ ). Show, by explicit calculation, that the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $\Delta_{A}(t)=t^{2}-b t+c$ are given by

$$b=\operatorname{tr} A=a_{11}+a_{22} \quad \text { and } \quad c=\operatorname{det} A=a_{11} a_{22}-a_{21} a_{12}$$

(ii) Suppose that $A$ has (not necessarily distinct) eigenvalues $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}$. Show that

$$\operatorname{tr} A=\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2} \quad \text { and } \quad \operatorname{det} A=\lambda_{1} \lambda_{2}$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Characteristic Polynomial]]: Polynomial $\Delta_A(t) = \det(A - tI)$
- [[Trace]]: Sum of diagonal entries of a matrix
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value associated with a square matrix
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Scalar $\lambda$ such that $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$
- Vieta's formulas relating polynomial coefficients to roots

## Approach
1. For part (i): Calculate the characteristic polynomial explicitly for a general 2Ã—2 matrix
2. For part (ii): Use the fact that eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic polynomial
3. Apply Vieta's formulas to connect polynomial coefficients with roots
