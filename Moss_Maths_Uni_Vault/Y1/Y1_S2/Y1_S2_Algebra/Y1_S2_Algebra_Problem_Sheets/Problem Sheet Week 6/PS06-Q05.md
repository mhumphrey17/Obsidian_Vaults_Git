# PS06-Q05: Computing Determinants by Expansion

## Problem Statement
Find the following determinants by expanding about an appropriate row/column.

$$\text{(i) } \left|\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & -1 & 4 & 1 \\
3 & 0 & -2 & 1 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 0 & 3
\end{array}\right| \quad \text{(ii) } \left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 4 & 0 & -3 \\
3 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
5 & 2 & 2 & 1
\end{array}\right|$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value computed from square matrices
- [[Cofactor]]: Signed minors used in determinant expansion
- [[Laplace Expansion]]: Method for computing determinants using rows/columns
- Strategic choice of expansion row/column to minimize computation

## Approach
1. Identify rows or columns with many zeros to minimize calculations
2. Use cofactor expansion along the chosen row/column
3. For each resulting 3×3 determinant, choose another row/column with zeros

## Solution
See [[PS06-Q05-Solution]]
