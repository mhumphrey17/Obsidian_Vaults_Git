# PS06-Q03: Properties of Adjugate Matrix

## Problem Statement
(i) Let $I$ be the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix matrix. Compute $\operatorname{adj} I$.
(ii) Let $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ a matrix and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$. Show that $\operatorname{adj} \lambda A=\lambda^{n-1} \operatorname{adj} A$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: Transpose of the cofactor matrix
- [[Identity Matrix]]: Matrix with 1s on diagonal and 0s elsewhere
- [[Cofactor]]: Signed minor used in adjugate construction
- [[Minor]]: Determinant of submatrix obtained by deleting a row and column
- [[Scalar Multiplication]]: Effect on determinants and adjugates

## Approach
1. For part (i): Calculate all cofactors of the identity matrix
2. For part (ii): Use the relationship between minors of $\lambda A$ and minors of $A$
3. Apply the scaling property of determinants

## Solution
See [[PS06-Q03-Solution]]
