# PS06-Q04: Invertibility Condition and Inverse

## Problem Statement
What condition on $x$ makes the following matrix invertible?

$$A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 3 & 1 \\
-4 & x & 0 \\
1 & 5 & 2
\end{array}\right)$$

When the condition is satisfied, find $A^{-1}$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Matrix Inversion]]: A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value that determines invertibility
- [[Elementary Row Operation]]: Row operations to simplify determinant calculation
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: Used in the formula $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A}\operatorname{adj}(A)$
- Parametric matrices and invertibility conditions

## Approach
1. Calculate the determinant of $A$ as a function of $x$
2. Find the value(s) of $x$ that make the determinant zero
3. For admissible values of $x$, use the adjugate formula to find the inverse

## Solution
See [[PS06-Q04-Solution]]
