# PS06-Q02: Cramer's Rule Proof

## Problem Statement
(Cramer's Rule) Let $A \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{F})$ with $\operatorname{det} A \neq 0$. Show that the unique solution to the linear system $A x=b$ is given explicitly by $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ with $x_{k}=\frac{\operatorname{det} A_{k}[b]}{\operatorname{det} A}$, where $A_{k}[b]$ is the matrix $A$ with column $k$ replaced by the vector $b$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Cramer's Rule]]: Method for solving linear systems using determinants
- [[Linear System]]: System of equations $Ax = b$
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value associated with square matrices
- [[Multilinearity of Determinants]]: Determinant is linear in each column/row
- [[Alternating Property of Determinants]]: Determinant is zero when columns are identical

## Approach
1. Express the system $Ax = b$ in terms of columns of $A$
2. Use multilinearity to expand $\det A_k[b]$
3. Use the alternating property to eliminate all terms except one
4. Solve for $x_k$

## Solution
