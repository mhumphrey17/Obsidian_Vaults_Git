# PS06-Q08: Rank, Submatrices, and Adjugate

## Problem Statement
Show that $\operatorname{rank} A=\max \{k \mid$ there exists a $k \times k$ submatrix of $A$ with nonzero determinant \}$. Consequently, $\operatorname{adj} A=0$ if $\operatorname{rank} A<n-1$ and $\operatorname{adj} A \neq 0$ if $\operatorname{rank} A \geq n-1$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Rank]]: The dimension of the column (or row) space of a matrix
- [[Submatrix]]: A matrix formed by deleting some rows and columns
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: The transpose of the cofactor matrix
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value indicating invertibility
- [[Linear Independence]]: Property of vectors in the column/row space

## Approach
1. Prove the rank equals the maximum size of a submatrix with nonzero determinant
2. Use this to understand when the adjugate matrix is zero
3. Connect rank to the existence of nonzero $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ minors

## Solution
See [[PS06-Q08-Solution]]
