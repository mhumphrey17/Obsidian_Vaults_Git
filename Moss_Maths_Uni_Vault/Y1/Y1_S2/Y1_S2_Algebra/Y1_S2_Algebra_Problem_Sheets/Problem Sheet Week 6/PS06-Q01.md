# PS06-Q01: Determinant Expansion and Inverse

## Problem Statement
Find the determinant of $A=\left(\begin{array}{lll}2 & 3 & 4 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 4 & 2\end{array}\right)$, by expanding about some row and some column (and check you get the same answer). Find $A^{-1}$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Determinant]]: Fundamental scalar quantity associated with square matrices
- [[Cofactor]]: Signed minors used in determinant expansion
- [[Minor]]: Determinants of submatrices obtained by deleting one row and column
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: Transpose of the cofactor matrix
- [[Matrix Inversion via Adjugate]]: Formula $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \operatorname{adj}(A)$

## Approach
1. Choose a row for expansion and calculate the determinant
2. Choose a column for expansion and verify the same result
3. Compute the adjugate matrix by finding all cofactors
4. Use the formula $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det A} \operatorname{adj}(A)$ to find the inverse

## Solution
