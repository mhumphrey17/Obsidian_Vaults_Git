# PS09-Q03: Orthonormal Basis for a Subspace

## Problem Statement
Find an orthonormal basis of $U := \text{span}\{(1,1,0,0), (1,1,1,2)\} \leq \mathbb{R}^4$ with respect to the dot product.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Orthonormal Basis]]: Basis consisting of pairwise orthogonal unit vectors
- [[Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]]: Algorithm to convert a basis into an orthonormal basis
- [[Span]]: Set of all linear combinations of given vectors
- [[Linear Independence]]: Property of spanning vectors

## Approach
1. Verify that the given vectors are linearly independent to confirm they form a basis for $U$
2. Apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to these vectors
3. Normalize the resulting orthogonal vectors

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q03-Solution]]
