# PS09-Q01: Orthonormal Basis for a Subspace

## Problem Statement
Find an orthonormal basis for the subspace $U := \{(x_1, x_2, x_3) | x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to the dot product.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Orthonormal Basis]]: Basis consisting of pairwise orthogonal unit vectors
- [[Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]]: Algorithm to convert a basis into an orthonormal basis
- [[Subspace]]: Subset of vector space closed under linear combinations
- [[Inner Product]]: Dot product in $\mathbb{R}^3$

## Approach
1. Find a basis for the subspace $U$ (the plane defined by the equation)
2. Apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to this basis
3. Normalize the resulting orthogonal vectors to get unit length

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q01-Solution]]
