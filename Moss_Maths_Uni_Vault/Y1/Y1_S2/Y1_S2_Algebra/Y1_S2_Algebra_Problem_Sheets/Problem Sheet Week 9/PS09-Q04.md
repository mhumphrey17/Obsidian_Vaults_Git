# PS09-Q04: QR Decomposition

## Problem Statement
Find the QR decomposition of the matrix $A$ given by

$$A = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & -1 \\
-2 & -1 & 0
\end{array}\right)$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[QR Decomposition]]: $A = QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is upper triangular
- [[Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]]: Process to obtain orthonormal columns
- [[Orthogonal Matrix]]: Matrix with orthonormal columns (Q^T Q = I)
- [[Upper Triangular Matrix]]: Matrix with zeros below diagonal

## Approach
1. Extract columns of $A$ as starting vectors
2. Apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to get orthonormal columns
3. Form matrix $Q$ with these orthonormal columns
4. Compute $R = Q^T A$
5. Verify that $A = QR$

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q04-Solution]]
