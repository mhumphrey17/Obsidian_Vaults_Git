# PS09-Q05: Orthogonal Complement of Sum of Subspaces

## Problem Statement
Let $U, W \leq V$ an inner product space. Show that $(U + W)^{\perp} = U^{\perp} \cap W^{\perp}$, where $U^{\perp} := \{u \in V \mid \langle u, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v \in U\}$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Orthogonal Complement]]: Set of vectors orthogonal to all vectors in a subspace
- [[Sum of Subspaces]]: $U + W = \{u + w \mid u \in U, w \in W\}$
- [[Inner Product Space]]: Vector space with compatible inner product
- Set equality proofs: Show both directions of inclusion

## Approach
1. Prove $(U + W)^{\perp} \subseteq U^{\perp} \cap W^{\perp}$
2. Prove $U^{\perp} \cap W^{\perp} \subseteq (U + W)^{\perp}$
3. Use properties of inner products and orthogonal complements

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q05-Solution]]
