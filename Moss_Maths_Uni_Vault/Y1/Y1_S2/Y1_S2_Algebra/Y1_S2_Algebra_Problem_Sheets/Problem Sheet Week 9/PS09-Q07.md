# PS09-Q07: Adjoints of Linear Map Operations

## Problem Statement
Let $V$ be an inner product space and suppose $\phi, \psi \in L(V)$ have adjoints. Show that $\psi \circ \phi ; \phi+\lambda \psi$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{F} ; \phi^{*}$ and $\mathrm{id}_{V}$ all have adjoints given by:
(i) $(\phi \circ \psi)^{*}=\psi^{*} \circ \phi^{*}$ (note the change of order here!).
(ii) $\left(\phi^{*}\right)^{*}=\phi$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Adjoint|Adjoint operation]]: The adjoint $\phi^*$ satisfying $\langle \phi(v), w \rangle = \langle v, \phi^*(w) \rangle$
- [[Linear Operator|Linear operators]] and their compositions
- [[Inner Product Space|Inner product spaces]] and their properties
- Linear combinations of operators
- Identity operator

## Approach
1. Recall the defining property of the adjoint: $\langle \chi(w), v \rangle = \langle w, \eta(v) \rangle$ means $\chi$ is an adjoint of $\eta$
2. For each case, verify this property holds for the proposed adjoint
3. Use properties of inner products (conjugate symmetry, linearity)
4. Pay special attention to the order reversal in composition

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q07-Solution]]
