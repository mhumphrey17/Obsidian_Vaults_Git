# PS09-Q02: QR Decomposition

## Problem Statement
Find the QR decomposition of the matrix $A$ given by

$$A = \left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[QR Decomposition]]: $A = QR$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $R$ is upper triangular
- [[Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization]]: Process to obtain orthonormal columns
- [[Orthogonal Matrix]]: Matrix with orthonormal columns
- [[Upper Triangular Matrix]]: Matrix with zeros below diagonal

## Approach
1. Apply Gram-Schmidt to the columns of $A$ to get orthonormal vectors
2. Form matrix $Q$ with these orthonormal columns
3. Compute $R = Q^T A$ (since $Q^T Q = I$)
4. Verify that $A = QR$

## Solution
See [[PS09-Q02-Solution]]
