# PS09-Q06: Self-Adjoint Operators and Hermitian Matrices

## Problem Statement
Let $A \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{C})$. Show that $\phi_A: \mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ is self-adjoint if and only if $A$ is Hermitian.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Self-adjoint|Self-adjoint operators]]: Operators $\phi$ where $\phi^* = \phi$
- [[Hermitian|Hermitian matrices]]: Complex matrices $A$ where $A^{\dagger} = A$
- [[Adjoint|Adjoint operation]]: The adjoint $\phi^*$ of a linear operator
- [[Inner Product Space|Inner product spaces]]: The complex vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$ with standard dot product
- [[Matrix Representation|Matrix representation of linear operators]]

## Approach
1. Use the relationship between the adjoint of a linear operator and the adjugate of its matrix representation
2. Show that $\phi_A$ is self-adjoint if and only if $\phi_A = \phi_A^*$
3. Connect this to the matrix condition $A = A^{\dagger}$
4. Use the fact that matrix representations of adjoints are given by the conjugate transpose

## Solution
