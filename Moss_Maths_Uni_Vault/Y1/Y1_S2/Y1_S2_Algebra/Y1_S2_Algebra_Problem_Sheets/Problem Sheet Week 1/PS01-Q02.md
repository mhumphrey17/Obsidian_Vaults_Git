# PS01-Q02: Subspace Properties (Complement, Intersection)

## Problem Statement
Let $V$ be a vector space with subspaces $U$ and $W$. Is $W^c = \{v \in V: v \notin W\}$ a subspace of $V$? Is $U \cap W$ a subspace of $V$? Give reasons.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Subspace|Subspaces]] and their properties
- [[Vector Space|Vector spaces]]
- Set operations (complement, intersection)
- Closure properties of subspaces

## Approach
For both questions, check whether the set satisfies the defining properties of a subspace:
1. Does the set contain the zero vector?
2. Is the set closed under addition? (If $u, v$ are in the set, is $u + v$ also in the set?)
3. Is the set closed under scalar multiplication? (If $v$ is in the set and $\lambda$ is a scalar, is $\lambda v$ also in the set?)

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q02-Solution]]
