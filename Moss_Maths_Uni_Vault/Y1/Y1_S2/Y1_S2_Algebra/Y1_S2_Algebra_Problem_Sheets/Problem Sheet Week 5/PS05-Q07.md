# PS05-Q07: Determinant Calculation using Sum Formula

## Problem Statement
Make a list of all the permutations $\sigma \in S_4$ together with $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)$ and the corresponding product term in the sum formula for $\operatorname{det}(A)$, when

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 3 & 2 & -1 \\
2 & -1 & 3 & 0 \\
1 & 3 & -1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}$$

Hence use the sum formula to compute $\operatorname{det}(A)$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Sum Formula]]: The fundamental formula defining determinants
- [[Permutation]]: Elements of the symmetric group $S_4$
- [[Sign Map]]: Function assigning Â±1 to each permutation
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value computed from a square matrix
- [[Permutation Groups]]: Structure of $S_4$ including identity, transpositions, 3-cycles, and 4-cycles

## Approach
1. List all 24 permutations in $S_4$
2. Calculate the sign of each permutation
3. Compute the corresponding product term from the matrix
4. Sum all contributions to get the determinant

## Difficulty Level
Advanced - This problem requires complete enumeration of $S_4$ and careful calculation of all terms.

## Solution
See [[PS05-Q07-Solution]]
