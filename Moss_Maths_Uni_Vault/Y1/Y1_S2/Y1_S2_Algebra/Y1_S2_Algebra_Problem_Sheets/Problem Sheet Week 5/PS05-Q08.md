# PS05-Q08: Vandermonde Determinants

## Problem Statement
8.(i) Show that

$$\left|\begin{array}{lll}
1 & x & x^{2} \\
1 & y & y^{2} \\
1 & z & z^{2}
\end{array}\right|=(y-x)(z-x)(z-y)$$

[Hint: think of this determinant as a polynomial in $x$, for fixed $y, z$, and identify two roots.]

(ii) Write down a formula for

$$\left|\begin{array}{llll}
1 & x & x^{2} & x^{3} \\
1 & y & y^{2} & y^{3} \\
1 & z & z^{2} & z^{3} \\
1 & w & w^{2} & w^{3}
\end{array}\right|$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Vandermonde Matrix]]: Special matrices with polynomial entries
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar function computed from square matrices
- [[Polynomial]]: Functions with powers of variables
- [[Polynomial Root]]: Values that make polynomials zero
- [[Interpolation]]: Constructing polynomials through given points

## Approach
1. View the determinant as a polynomial in one variable
2. Use the hint to identify roots of this polynomial
3. Determine the degree and leading coefficient
4. Factor the polynomial to get the final form
5. Generalize the pattern to higher dimensions

## Difficulty Level
Advanced - This problem requires insight into polynomial structure and pattern recognition.

## Solution
