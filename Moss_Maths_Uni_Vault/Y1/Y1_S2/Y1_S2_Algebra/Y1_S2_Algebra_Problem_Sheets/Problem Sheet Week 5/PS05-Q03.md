# PS05-Q03: Computing Determinants using Row/Column Operations

## Problem Statement
Compute the following determinants by using elementary row/column operations to convert the matrix to a simpler form, e.g. triangular or blockwise triangular.

(i) $\left|\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 2 & -1 \\ 2 & -1 & 3 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 & -1 & 2\end{array}\right|$

(ii) $\left|\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 2 & 4 & 0 & -3 \\ 3 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 5 & 2 & 2 & 1\end{array}\right|$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Elementary Row Operation]]: Basic operations that can be performed on matrix rows
- [[Elementary Column Operation]]: Basic operations that can be performed on matrix columns
- [[Determinant Properties Under Elementary Operations]]: How determinants change under operations
- [[Triangular Matrix]]: Matrix with zeros above or below the main diagonal
- [[Block Triangular Matrix]]: Triangular structure at the block level

## Approach
1. Identify which elementary operations will help create zeros where needed
2. Apply row/column operations systematically to achieve triangular or block triangular form
3. Track how the determinant changes with each operation
4. Calculate the final determinant using the simplified form
