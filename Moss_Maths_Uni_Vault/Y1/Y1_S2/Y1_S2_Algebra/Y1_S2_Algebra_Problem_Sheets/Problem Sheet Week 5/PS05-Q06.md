# PS05-Q06: Determinant of Permutation Matrix

## Problem Statement
Given a permutation $\tau \in S_n$, let $P(\tau) \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ be the matrix with entries

$$P(\tau)_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \tau(j) = i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Show that $\operatorname{det}(P) = \operatorname{sgn}(\tau)$, using the sum formula.

## Key Concepts Involved
