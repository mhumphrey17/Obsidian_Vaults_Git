# PS05-Q02: Determinant Product Formula for Lower Triangular Matrices

## Problem Statement
Let $A$ and $B$ be lower triangular matrices. Prove directly that the product formula $\operatorname{det}(AB) = \operatorname{det}(A) \cdot \operatorname{det}(B)$ holds in this case.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Product Formula for Determinants]]: The general formula relating determinants of products to products of determinants
- [[Triangular Matrix]]: Matrix with zeros above or below the main diagonal
- [[Matrix Multiplication]]: How to multiply two matrices together
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value computed from a square matrix

## Approach
1. Use the fact that the product of two lower triangular matrices is also lower triangular
2. Apply the result from Q1 that the determinant of a lower triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries
3. Show how the diagonal entries of $AB$ relate to the diagonal entries of $A$ and $B$

## Difficulty Level
Warmup - This builds directly on the result from Q1 and introduces an important special case.

## Solution
See [[PS05-Q02-Solution]]
