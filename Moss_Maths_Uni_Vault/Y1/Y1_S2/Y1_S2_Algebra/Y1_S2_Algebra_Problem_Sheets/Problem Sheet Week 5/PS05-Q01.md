# PS05-Q01: Permutations and Determinant of Lower Triangular Matrix

## Problem Statement
Let $\sigma \in S_{n}$ be a permutation such that $\sigma(i) \geq i$ for all $i$. By considering the expression $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sigma(i)-i)$, prove that $\sigma=\mathrm{id}$, the identity permutation. Deduce that the determinant of a lower triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Permutation]]: The mathematical structure representing a rearrangement of elements
- [[Sign Map]]: Maps permutations to +1 or -1, used in determinant calculations
- [[Determinant]]: The scalar value computed from a square matrix
- [[Triangular Matrix]]: Matrix with zeros either above or below the main diagonal
- [[Determinants: The Sum Formula]]: The fundamental formula for computing determinants

## Approach
1. Analyze the constraint $\sigma(i) \geq i$ to understand what types of permutations satisfy this condition
2. Use the fact that $\sigma$ is a bijection to simplify the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sigma(i)-i)$
3. Apply logical constraints to deduce that $\sigma = id$
4. Connect this result to the determinant formula for lower triangular matrices

## Difficulty Level
Warmup - This is a foundational problem that introduces key concepts before more complex applications.
