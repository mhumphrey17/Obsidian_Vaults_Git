# PS05-Q05: Properties of Determinants (Scalar, Skew-Symmetric)

## Problem Statement
Suppose that $A \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ and that $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$.

(i) Show that $\operatorname{det}(\lambda A) = \lambda^n \operatorname{det}(A)$.

(ii) Suppose that $-1 \neq 1$ in $\mathbb{F}$, e.g. $\mathbb{F} \neq \mathbb{F}_2$. Show that, if $A$ is skew-symmetric (i.e. $A^T = -A$) and $n$ is odd, then $\operatorname{det}(A) = 0$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Determinant]]: The scalar function defined on square matrices
- [[Multilinearity of Determinants]]: Determinant is linear in each row/column
- [[Symmetric Matrix]]: Matrix that equals its transpose
- [[Skew-Symmetric Matrix]]: Matrix that equals the negative of its transpose
- [[Field]]: Algebraic structure with addition and multiplication

## Approach
1. For part (i), use the multilinearity property of determinants
2. For part (ii), use properties of the transpose operation and determinants
3. Consider the implications of the constraint on the field

## Difficulty Level
Homework - These problems explore fundamental properties of determinants.
