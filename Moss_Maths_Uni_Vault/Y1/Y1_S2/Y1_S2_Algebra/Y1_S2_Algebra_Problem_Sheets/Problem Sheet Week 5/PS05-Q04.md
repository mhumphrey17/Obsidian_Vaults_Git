# PS05-Q04: Computing Determinants

## Problem Statement
Compute the following determinants.

(i) $\left|\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 3 & -1 & 0 \\ 2 & 4 & 0 & -1 \\ 3 & 1 & 1 & -2 \\ 0 & 2 & 2 & 1\end{array}\right|$

(ii) $\left|\begin{array}{cccc}3 & 1 & 6 & 2 \\ 3 & 5 & 11 & 2 \\ 0 & 8 & 11 & 0 \\ 2 & 7 & 9 & 1\end{array}\right|$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Determinant]]: Scalar value computed from a square matrix
- [[Elementary Row Operation]]: Basic operations for matrix manipulation
