# PS01-Q05: Subspace Properties (Union, Sum)

## Problem Statement
Let $V$ be a vector space with subspaces $U$ and $W$. Is $U \cup W$ a subspace of $V$? Is $U + W = \{v \in V: v = u + w \text{ for some } u \in U, w \in W\}$ a subspace of $V$? Give reasons.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Subspace|Subspaces]] and their properties
- [[Sum Of Subspaces|Sum of subspaces]]
- [[Vector Space|Vector spaces]]
- Union of sets compared to sum of subspaces
- Closure properties required for subspaces

## Approach
For both questions, check whether the set satisfies the defining properties of a subspace:
1. Does the set contain the zero vector?
2. Is the set closed under addition? (If $u, v$ are in the set, is $u + v$ also in the set?)
3. Is the set closed under scalar multiplication? (If $v$ is in the set and $\lambda$ is a scalar, is $\lambda v$ also in the set?)

For the union, consider possible counterexamples where two vectors in different subspaces add to a vector not in either subspace.

For the sum, verify that it satisfies the subspace conditions by working with the definition of the sum directly.

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q05-Solution]]
