# PS01-Q09: Projection Map Formula
## Problem Statement
Find the linear map $\phi$ defining the projection onto the line $L: y=m x$ in the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Map]]: A function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication
- [[Matrix Representation]]: Representing a linear transformation using a matrix
- [[Projection]]: A linear transformation that maps vectors onto a subspace
- [[Orthogonal Projection]]: A projection where vectors are mapped along a perpendicular direction

## Approach
To find the projection formula:
1. Determine the direction of the line $L: y=mx$
2. Find the direction perpendicular to $L$
3. For any point $P=(a,b)$, construct the line through $P$ perpendicular to $L$
4. Find the intersection of this perpendicular line with $L$
5. Express the result as a function of the coordinates of $P$

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q09-Solution]]
