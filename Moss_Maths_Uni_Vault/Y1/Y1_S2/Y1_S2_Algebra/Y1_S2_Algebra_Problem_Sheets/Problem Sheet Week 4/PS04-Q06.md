# PS04-Q06: Strict Rank Inequality Example

## Problem Statement

Give an example showing that the inequality in Q2(a) can be strict, using $2 \times 2$ matrices. That is, find $2 \times 2$ matrices $A, B$ such that $\operatorname{rank}(AB) < \min\{\operatorname{rank} A, \operatorname{rank} B\}$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Rank]]: The dimension of the column space (or row space) of a matrix
- [[Matrix Product]]: Multiplication of matrices and its effect on rank
- [[Counterexample]]: Finding specific examples to show an inequality can be strict
- [[Nullspace]]: Understanding how matrix multiplication affects null spaces

## Approach

1. Recall that Q2(a) showed $\operatorname{rank}(AB) \leq \min\{\operatorname{rank} A, \operatorname{rank} B\}$
2. Construct matrices where this inequality is strict
3. Choose matrices so that the column space of $B$ is mapped into the null space of $A$

## Solution

See [[PS04-Q06-Solution]]
