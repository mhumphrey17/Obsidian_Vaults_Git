# PS04-Q07: Linear Maps on Matrix Space and Invertibility

## Problem Statement

Let $V$ be the vector space of all $n \times n$ matrices. What is the dimension of $V$?

(a) For any $A \in V$ define a map $L_A: V \rightarrow V: B \mapsto AB$. Show that $L_A$ is linear.

(b) Suppose that $AX = I$, for some $X \in V$. Show that $L_A$ is surjective and deduce, from the Rank-Nullity Theorem, that it is therefore also injective.

(c) Compute $L_A(XA - I)$ and deduce that $XA = I$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Matrix Space]]: The vector space of all $n \times n$ matrices
- [[Linear Maps]]: Functions preserving vector space structure
- [[Left/Right Inverses]]: Connection between left and right invertibility
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: Fundamental theorem relating dimension, rank, and nullity
- [[Vector Space]]: Understanding matrices as vectors in an abstract space

## Approach

1. Calculate dimension by counting degrees of freedom
2. Verify linearity of the left multiplication map
3. Use existence of left inverse to prove surjectivity
4. Apply Rank-Nullity to deduce injectivity
5. Show that left inverses are also right inverses
