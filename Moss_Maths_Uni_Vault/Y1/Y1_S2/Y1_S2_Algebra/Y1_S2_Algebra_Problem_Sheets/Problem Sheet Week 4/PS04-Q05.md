# PS04-Q05: Standard Matrix Representation and Matrix Equivalence

## Problem Statement

Suppose that $V, W$ are vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$ with $\dim V = n$, $\dim W = m$ and that $\phi: V \rightarrow W$ is a linear map of rank $r$. 

Show that one can choose bases for $V$ and $W$ with respect to which $\phi$ is represented by the matrix $D_r = (d_{ij}) \in M_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$, given by:

$$d_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = j \leq r \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Deduce that, if matrices $A, B \in M_{m,n}(\mathbb{F})$ satisfy $\operatorname{rank} A = \operatorname{rank} B$, then they are equivalent, i.e., $B = P^{-1}AQ$ for invertible matrices $P, Q$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Matrix Representation]]: How linear maps are represented with respect to bases
- [[Matrix Equivalence]]: Relationship between matrices representing the same linear map
- [[Basis]]: Choice of basis affects matrix representation 
- [[Rank]]: Invariant under basis changes
- [[Standard Matrix Form]]: Canonical representation of linear maps

## Approach

1. Construct appropriate bases for $V$ and $W$ based on the kernel and image of $\phi$
2. Show these bases give the desired matrix representation
3. Apply this result to arbitrary matrices to prove equivalence

## Solution
