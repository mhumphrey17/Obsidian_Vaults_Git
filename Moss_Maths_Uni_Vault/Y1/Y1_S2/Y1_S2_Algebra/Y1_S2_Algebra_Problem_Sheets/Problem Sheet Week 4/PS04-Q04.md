# PS04-Q04: Rank and Factorization of Matrices

## Problem Statement

Find the ranks of the following matrices, by finding a basis for either the row space or the column space. Write each $A = BC$ with $B$ and $C$ of maximal rank.

(a) $$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
2 & 0 & 4 & -2 \\
2 & 0 & 4 & -2
\end{pmatrix}$$

(b) $$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
2 & 5 & 5 & 1 \\
-2 & -3 & 0 & 3
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Rank]]: Dimension of the column (or row) space
- [[Matrix Factorization]]: Writing a matrix as a product of matrices with special properties
- [[Column Space]]: Span of column vectors
- [[Row Space]]: Span of row vectors
- [[Gaussian Elimination]]: Tool for finding bases and solving systems

## Approach

1. Find bases for the column space using linear dependence analysis
2. Determine the rank
3. Create factorizations using the bases found

## Solution

See [[PS04-Q04-Solution]]
