# PS04-Q01: Rank and Factorization of a Matrix

## Problem Statement

Find the column and the row ranks of the following matrix and confirm that they are equal. Write $A = BC$, in two different ways, with $B$ and $C$ of maximal rank.

$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 2 & -1 \\
2 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}$$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Rank]]: The dimension of the column (or row) space of a matrix
- [[Column Space]]: The span of the column vectors of a matrix
- [[Row Space]]: The span of the row vectors of a matrix
- [[Matrix Factorization]]: Writing a matrix as a product of matrices with special properties

## Approach

1. Find a basis for the column space by identifying linear dependencies
2. Find a basis for the row space by identifying linear dependencies
3. Verify that column rank = row rank
4. Use two different factorization methods: column basis method and row basis method

## Solution

See [[PS04-Q01-Solution]]
