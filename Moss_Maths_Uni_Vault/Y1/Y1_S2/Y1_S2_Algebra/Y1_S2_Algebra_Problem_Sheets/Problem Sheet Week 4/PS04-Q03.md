# PS04-Q03: Isomorphism Defined by Basis Mapping

## Problem Statement

Let $\alpha: v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and $\beta: w_1, \ldots, w_n$ be bases of $V$ and $W$, respectively. Show that the map $\phi: V \rightarrow W$, 

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i v_i \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i w_i$$

is well-defined and is an isomorphism.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Isomorphism]]: A bijective linear map between vector spaces
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set
- [[Well-defined Function]]: A function that gives the same output for equivalent inputs
- [[Linear Independence]]: Property ensuring unique basis representations

## Approach

1. Prove the map is well-defined using uniqueness of basis representations
2. Show the map is linear
3. Prove the map is injective (trivial kernel)
4. Prove the map is surjective (full rank)

## Solution

See [[PS04-Q03-Solution]]
