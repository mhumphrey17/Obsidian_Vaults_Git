# PS07-Q02: Eigenvalues of Nilpotent Operators

## Problem Statement
An operator $\phi: V \rightarrow V$ is called nilpotent if $\phi^{N}=0$ for some $N \geq 1$. Show that, if $V \neq\{0\}$, then 0 is an eigenvalue of $\phi$ and it is the only eigenvalue.

## Key Concepts Involved
- **Nilpotent Operator**: Linear operator with $\phi^N = 0$ for some positive integer $N$
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Scalar $\lambda$ such that $\phi(\mathbf{v}) = \lambda\mathbf{v}$ for some non-zero $\mathbf{v}$
- [[Kernel]]: Null space of a linear operator
- [[Determinant]]: Product formula property
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: Relationship between kernel and image

## Approach
1. Prove that 0 is an eigenvalue by showing $\ker(\phi) \neq \{0\}$
2. Prove no other eigenvalue exists using the nilpotent property

## Solution
See [[PS07-Q02-Solution]]
