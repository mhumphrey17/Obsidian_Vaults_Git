# PS07-Q04: Solving Linear Recurrence using Diagonalisation

## Problem Statement
Solve the following linear recurrence, with initial conditions $x_{0}=-1, y_{0}=0$.

$$\begin{aligned}
x_{n+1} & =3 x_{n}+6 y_{n} \\
y_{n+1} & =6 x_{n}-2 y_{n}
\end{aligned}$$

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Recurrence]]: System of difference equations with constant coefficients
- [[Diagonalisation]]: Method for computing powers of matrices
- [[Matrix Powers]]: Efficiently computed using diagonalisation
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Critical for determining recurrence behavior
- [[Eigenvector]]: Basis for matrix diagonalisation

## Approach
1. Express the recurrence as a matrix equation $\mathbf{v}_{n+1} = A\mathbf{v}_n$
2. Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix
3. Diagonalise the matrix to compute $A^n$
4. Apply the initial conditions to find the explicit solution

## Solution
