# PS07-Q07: Complex vs Real Matrix Similarity

## Problem Statement
(i) Suppose $P \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{C})$ is invertible. Show that there is a non-zero $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\operatorname{Re}(\lambda P) \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{R})$ is invertible.

(ii) Deduce that if $A, B \in M_{n, n}(\mathbb{R})$ are similar over $\mathbb{C}$, i.e. $A=P^{-1} B P$ for some $P \in \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C})$, then they are also similar over $\mathbb{R}$, i.e. $A=Q^{-1} B Q$ for some $Q \in \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R})$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Matrix Similarity]]: Transformation by invertible matrices
- [[Complex Numbers]]: Extended field for matrix entries
- [[Real Numbers]]: Restriction to real-valued matrices
- [[Invertible Matrix]]: Existence and preservation conditions
- [[Similar Matrices and Determinants]]: Properties preserved under similarity

## Approach
1. For part (i): Use polynomial argument about determinant as function of scaling
2. For part (ii): Apply result from part (i) to construct real similarity
3. Use properties of real matrices under complex operations

## Solution
See [[PS07-Q07-Solution]]
