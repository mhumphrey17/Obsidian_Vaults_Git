# PS07-Q05: Invertibility and Eigenvalues of Inverse

## Problem Statement
Let $A$ be a square matrix.

(i) Show that $A$ is invertible if and only if 0 is not an eigenvalue of $A$.
(ii) If $A$ is invertible and $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, show that $\lambda^{-1}$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Matrix Inversion]]: Existence and uniqueness conditions
- [[Eigenvalue]]: Fundamental property of square matrices
- [[Eigenvector]]: Associated with each eigenvalue
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]: Connection between rank and kernel
- [[Invertibility]]: Characterized by several equivalent conditions

## Approach
1. For part (i): Use the characterization of invertibility via rank/kernel properties
2. For part (ii): Manipulate the eigenvalue equation using matrix inverse
3. Connect eigenvalue properties to matrix properties

## Solution
See [[PS07-Q05-Solution]]
