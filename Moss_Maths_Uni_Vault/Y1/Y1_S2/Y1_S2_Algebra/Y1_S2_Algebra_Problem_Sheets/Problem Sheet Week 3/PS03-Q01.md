# PS03-Q01: Spanning Sum of Subspaces

## Problem Statement

Suppose that $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $V$ and that $u_1, \ldots, u_m$ spans $U$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ spans $W$. Show that the combined list $u_1, \ldots, u_m, w_1, \ldots, w_n$ spans the subspace

$$U + W = \{v \in V : v = u + w \text{ for some } u \in U, w \in W\}$$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Sum of Subspaces]]: The sum of subspaces U + W consisting of all vectors that can be written as the sum of a vector from U and a vector from W
- [[Spanning Set]]: A set of vectors whose linear combinations generate an entire subspace
- [[Subspace]]: A subset of a vector space closed under addition and scalar multiplication
- [[Linear Combination]]: A sum of scalar multiples of vectors

## Approach

1. Take any vector in U + W and express it as v = u + w where u ∈ U and w ∈ W
2. Express u and w as linear combinations of their respective spanning sets
3. Show that v can be written as a linear combination of the combined list

## Solution
