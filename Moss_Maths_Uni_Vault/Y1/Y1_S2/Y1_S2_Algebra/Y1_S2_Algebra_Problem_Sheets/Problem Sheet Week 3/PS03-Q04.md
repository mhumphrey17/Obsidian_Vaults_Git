# PS03-Q04: Basis for Column Space

## Problem Statement

Working over the field $\mathbb{Q}$, find a basis for the column space of each of the following matrices:

(i) $A = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}$

(ii) $B = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}$

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Column Space]]: The subspace spanned by the columns of a matrix
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set for a subspace
- [[Sifting Algorithm]]: Method to extract a basis from a spanning set
- [[Linear Independence]]: Essential property for basis vectors

## Approach

1. Use the sifting algorithm: examine columns one by one
2. Keep a column if it's not a linear combination of previous kept columns
3. Delete a column if it can be expressed in terms of previous columns
4. The kept columns form a basis for the column space
