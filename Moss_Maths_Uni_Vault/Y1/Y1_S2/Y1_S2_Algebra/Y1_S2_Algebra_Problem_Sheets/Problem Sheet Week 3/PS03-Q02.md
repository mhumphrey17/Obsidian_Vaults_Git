# PS03-Q02: Symmetric Matrices Subspace and Basis

## Problem Statement

A matrix $A \in M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$ is symmetric if $A^T = A$, where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$.

(a) Show that the set of symmetric matrices forms a linear subspace of $M_{n,n}(\mathbb{F})$.

(b) For $n = 2$ and $n = 3$, find a basis for this subspace and determine its dimension.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Symmetric Matrix]]: A square matrix that equals its transpose
- [[Subspace]]: A subset closed under addition and scalar multiplication
- [[Basis]]: A linearly independent spanning set
- [[Dimension]]: The number of vectors in any basis
- [[Matrix Spaces]]: Vector spaces consisting of matrices

## Approach

1. Verify subspace properties: closure under addition and scalar multiplication
2. For specific dimensions, find the general form of symmetric matrices
3. Identify natural basis vectors by looking at the independent parameters
4. Count the dimension by counting the degrees of freedom
