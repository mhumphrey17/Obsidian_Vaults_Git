# PS03-Q07: Linear Independence from Set Intersections

## Problem Statement

Let $S_1, \ldots, S_n \subseteq \{1, \ldots, m\}$ be $n$ distinct subsets such that:
- Each contains an odd number of elements
- The intersection $S_i \cap S_j$ of any distinct pair of sets contains an even number of elements

Show that $n \leq m$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Field of Two Elements]]: $\mathbb{F}_2$ where arithmetic is done modulo 2
- [[Linear Independence]]: The key property we'll use to prove the bound
- [[Orthonormal Vectors]]: A connection to PS02-Q06
- Set cardinality and parity
- Vector space over finite fields

## Approach

1. Encode sets as vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^m$
2. Translate set properties into inner product conditions
3. Apply linear independence results from earlier problem sheets
4. Use dimension bounds to get the desired inequality

## Solution

See [[PS03-Q07-Solution]]
