# PS03-Q06: Basis and Coordinates in Polynomial Space

## Problem Statement

Let $V = \{f \in \mathbb{Q}[x] : \deg f \leq 2\}$ and consider the following polynomials in $V$:

$$f_1 = (x-2)(x-3), \quad f_2 = (x-1)(x-3), \quad f_3 = (x-1)(x-2)$$

(i) What is the dimension of $V$? Why?

(ii) Show that $f_1, f_2, f_3$ are independent and deduce that they form a basis of $V$.

(iii) Find a polynomial $g \in V$ such that $g(1) = 5$, $g(2) = 7$, $g(3) = 1$, by writing $g = \lambda_1 f_1 + \lambda_2 f_2 + \lambda_3 f_3$ and solving for the $\lambda_i$'s.
