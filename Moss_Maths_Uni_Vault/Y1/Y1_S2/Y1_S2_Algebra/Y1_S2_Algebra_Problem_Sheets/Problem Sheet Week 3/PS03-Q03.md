# PS03-Q03: Linear Independence and Basis Extension in M2x2

## Problem Statement

Show that the two matrices $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ are linearly independent in the space of matrices $M_{2,2}(\mathbb{F})$ and extend them to a basis of $M_{2,2}(\mathbb{F})$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Linear Independence]]: A set of vectors (matrices) with no non-trivial linear dependence
- [[Basis Extension]]: Adding vectors to an independent set to form a basis
- [[Matrix Spaces]]: Vector spaces consisting of matrices
- [[Dimension]]: $M_{2,2}(\mathbb{F})$ has dimension 4

## Approach

1. Test linear independence by setting up a linear dependence equation
2. Solve to verify only the trivial solution exists
3. Find two additional matrices to complete the basis
4. Verify the extended set is linearly independent

## Solution

See [[PS03-Q03-Solution]]
