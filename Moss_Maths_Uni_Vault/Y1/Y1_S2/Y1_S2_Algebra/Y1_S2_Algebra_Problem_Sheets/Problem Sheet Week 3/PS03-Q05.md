# PS03-Q05: Matrix Representation with Different Bases

## Problem Statement

Let $\alpha: e_1, e_2, e_3$ and $\beta: f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4$ be the standard bases of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$, respectively. Let $\phi: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$ be the linear map defined by:

$$(a, b, c) \mapsto (b+c, c+a, a+b, 0)$$

(i) Compute the matrix representing $\phi$ with respect to the bases $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

(ii) Show that $\gamma: f_2+f_3, f_1+f_3, f_1+f_2, f_4$ is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^4$.

(iii) Compute the matrix representing $\phi$ with respect to the bases $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.

## Key Concepts Involved

- [[Matrix Representation]]: How to represent a linear map as a matrix with respect to given bases
- [[Linear Maps]]: Functions between vector spaces preserving linear structure
- [[Change of Basis]]: How representations change when bases change
- [[Standard Basis]]: The natural coordinate basis vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$

## Approach

1. Find the matrix representation by applying $\phi$ to each basis vector in the domain
2. For part (ii), verify linear independence of the given vectors
3. For part (iii), express the image vectors in terms of the new basis
