# Scalar

## Definition
A **scalar** is an element of the field $\mathbb{F}$ over which a vector space $V$ is defined. Scalars are used in the operation of scalar multiplication, which takes a scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ and a vector $v \in V$ and produces another vector $\lambda v \in V$.

## Properties
- Scalars satisfy all the properties of the field they belong to, including:
  - Associativity and commutativity of addition and multiplication
  - Existence of additive and multiplicative identities (0 and 1)
  - Existence of additive inverses for all elements
  - Existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements
  - Distributivity of multiplication over addition

- In the context of vector spaces, scalars interact with vectors through scalar multiplication, which satisfies:
  - $\lambda(v + w) = \lambda v + \lambda w$ (distributivity over vector addition)
  - $(\lambda + \mu)v = \lambda v + \mu v$ (distributivity over scalar addition)
  - $(\lambda\mu)v = \lambda(\mu v)$ (compatibility with scalar multiplication)
  - $1v = v$ (identity property)

## Examples
1. In real vector spaces (such as $\mathbb{R}^n$), the scalars are real numbers $\mathbb{R}$.

2. In complex vector spaces (such as $\mathbb{C}^n$), the scalars are complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$.

3. In a vector space over the rational numbers (such as $\mathbb{Q}^n$), the scalars are rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

4. In a vector space over a finite field (such as $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ for a prime $p$), the scalars are elements of that finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$.

5. In the specific example from the textbook, $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$ forms a field under addition and multiplication modulo 3, and these elements would be the scalars for a vector space over $\mathbb{Z}_3$.

## Important Theorems/Results
- For any scalar $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ and any vector $v \in V$:
  - $\lambda 0 = 0$ (scalar multiplication of the zero vector)
  - $0 v = 0$ (zero scalar multiplication)
  - $\lambda(-v) = -(\lambda v) = (-\lambda)v$ (interaction with negatives)
  - If $\lambda v = 0$, then either $\lambda = 0$ or $v = 0$ (zero-product property)

## Connections to Other Concepts
- Scalars are elements of a [[Field]], which provides the algebraic structure required for the scalar multiplication operation in a [[Vector Space]].
- The operation of [[Scalar Multiplication]] is one of the fundamental operations in a vector space, alongside vector addition.
- [[Linear Combination]]s involve multiplying vectors by scalars and then adding the resulting vectors.
- A [[Linear Map]] preserves scalar multiplication, meaning $L(\lambda v) = \lambda L(v)$ for any scalar $\lambda$ and vector $v$.

## Related Problems
- [[PS01-Q06]] - Understanding scalar multiplication in the context of linear maps.
- Many problems involving vector spaces implicitly use the concept of scalars.

## Notes
- The term "scalar" derives from the fact that these quantities scale vectors (changing their magnitude but not their direction in geometric contexts).
- The distinction between scalars and vectors is fundamental in linear algebra and more broadly in mathematics and physics.
- In elementary contexts (particularly in physics), scalars are often described simply as "quantities with magnitude but no direction," in contrast to vectors which have both.
- Different choices of scalar fields lead to vector spaces with different properties. For example, vector spaces over $\mathbb{R}$ can be geometrically visualized in ways that vector spaces over finite fields cannot.
- In more advanced contexts, the field of scalars can be extended or restricted to create different types of vector spaces from the same set of vectors.
