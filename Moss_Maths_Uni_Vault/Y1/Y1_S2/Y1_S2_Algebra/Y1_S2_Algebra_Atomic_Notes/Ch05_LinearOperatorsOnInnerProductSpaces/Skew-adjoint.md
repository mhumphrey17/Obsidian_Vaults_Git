# Skew-adjoint

## Definition
Let $V$ be an inner product space and $\phi \in L(V)$ a linear operator. We say $\phi$ is **skew-adjoint** if $\phi^{*} = -\phi$.

Equivalently, for all $v, w \in V$:
$$\langle\phi(v), w\rangle = -\langle v, \phi(w)\rangle$$

## Properties
1. **Imaginary eigenvalues**: All eigenvalues are purely imaginary (or zero)
2. **Orthogonal eigenvectors**: Eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal
3. **Normal**: Every skew-adjoint operator is normal ($\phi^{*}\phi = \phi\phi^{*}$)
4. **Zero trace**: When represented as a matrix, the trace is zero

## Examples

### Example 1: Differential Operator
On $C^{\infty}[0, 2\pi]$ with periodic boundary conditions, the differentiation operator $D(f) = f'$ is skew-adjoint with respect to the $L^2$ inner product.

### Example 2: Skew-symmetric Matrix (Real)
The real matrix:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
is skew-adjoint since $A^T = -A$.

### Example 3: Skew-Hermitian Matrix (Complex)
The complex matrix:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$
is skew-adjoint since $A^{\dagger} = -A$.

### Example 4: Relationship to Self-adjoint
If $\phi$ is self-adjoint over $\mathbb{C}$, then $i\phi$ is skew-adjoint (Example 5.1.7(iii)).

## Matrix Characterization
- **Over $\mathbb{R}$**: $\phi$ is skew-adjoint if and only if its matrix is skew-symmetric: $A^T = -A$
- **Over $\mathbb{C}$**: $\phi$ is skew-adjoint if and only if its matrix is skew-Hermitian: $A^{\dagger} = -A$

## Key Properties

### Diagonal Entries
If $A$ represents a skew-adjoint operator:
- Over $\mathbb{R}$: Diagonal entries are zero
- Over $\mathbb{C}$: Diagonal entries are purely imaginary

### Exponential Map
$e^{\phi}$ where $\phi$ is skew-adjoint gives a unitary/orthogonal transformation:
- $(e^{\phi})^{*} = e^{-\phi} = (e^{\phi})^{-1}$

## Related Theorems
- Skew-adjoint operators over $\mathbb{R}$ have eigenvalues coming in purely imaginary conjugate pairs
- Like self-adjoint operators, skew-adjoint operators are orthogonally diagonalizable

## Applications
- **Physics**: Generators of rotations and other one-parameter groups
- **Differential equations**: Hamilton's equations in mechanics
- **Group theory**: Lie algebras of orthogonal and unitary groups
- **Quantum mechanics**: Time evolution generators

## Related Concepts
- [[Self-adjoint]]: Operators where $\phi^{*} = \phi$ (contrast with $\phi^{*} = -\phi$)
- [[Normal]]: General class including both self-adjoint and skew-adjoint operators
- [[Unitary Transformation]]: Can be generated by exponentiating skew-adjoint operators
- [[Hermitian]]: Self-adjoint matrix version
- [[Skew-Hermitian]]: Skew-adjoint matrix version over $\mathbb{C}$
- [[Skew-symmetric]]: Skew-adjoint matrix version over $\mathbb{R}$

## Notes
- Skew-adjoint operators generate one-parameter families of unitary/orthogonal transformations
- The relationship $i\phi$ (self-adjoint) â†” $\phi$ (skew-adjoint) is important in physics
- Skew-adjoint operators cannot have real non-zero eigenvalues
- They play a crucial role in the study of conservation laws in physics
