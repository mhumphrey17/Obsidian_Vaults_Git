# Chapter 2: Determinants and Inverses

## Overview
Chapter 2 explores determinants, a fundamental scalar function associated with square matrices, and their applications to matrix inversion. The determinant provides critical information about matrices, including whether they are invertible, how they transform volumes, and how to efficiently calculate inverses. This chapter builds on the vector space and linear map foundations from Chapter 1 to develop a powerful tool in linear algebra that has wide-ranging applications.

## Key Concepts

### 2.1 Determinants: the sum formula
- [[Determinant]]: A scalar value assigned to a square matrix, defined using permutations and their signs
- [[Sign Map]]: A function that assigns +1 or -1 to permutations based on their cycle structure
- [[Elementary Row Operation]]: Basic operations on matrix rows that affect determinants in predictable ways
- [[Elementary Column Operation]]: Basic operations on matrix columns with similar determinant effects
- [[Permutation Matrix]]: Matrices representing permutations, with determinant equal to the sign of the permutation
- [[Triangular Matrix]]: Matrices with determinant equal to the product of diagonal entries
- [[Block Triangular Matrix]]: Matrices with block structure whose determinant is the product of determinants of diagonal blocks

### 2.2 Properties of Determinants
- [[Multilinearity of Determinants]]: The determinant is linear in each row or column when others are fixed
- [[Alternating Property of Determinants]]: Matrices with repeated rows or columns have zero determinant
- [[Determinant Properties Under Elementary Operations]]: How elementary operations affect determinants:
  - Scaling a row/column by α multiplies the determinant by α
  - Adding a multiple of one row/column to another preserves the determinant
  - Swapping rows/columns changes the sign of the determinant

### 2.3 Characterization of Determinants
- [[Characterization of Determinants]]: The determinant is uniquely determined (up to a scalar) by multilinearity, the alternating property, and its value on the identity matrix
- [[Product Formula for Determinants]]: The determinant of a product equals the product of determinants
- [[Determinant of a Linear Operator]]: The determinant is well-defined for linear operators, independent of the chosen basis
- [[Similar Matrices and Determinants]]: Similar matrices have the same determinant

### 2.4 Minors, Adjugates and Inverses
- [[Minor]]: The determinant of a submatrix obtained by deleting a row and column
- [[Cofactor]]: A signed minor, used in determinant expansions
- [[Laplace Expansion]]: Method for calculating determinants using cofactors
- [[Adjugate Matrix]]: The transpose of the cofactor matrix
- [[Matrix Inversion via Adjugate]]: Method for finding the inverse using $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\operatorname{adj}(A)$

## Main Themes

### Determinant as a Volume Metric
One fundamental interpretation of the determinant is as a volume scaling factor. For a linear transformation represented by a matrix $A$, the absolute value of its determinant $|\det(A)|$ gives the factor by which the transformation scales volumes. When $\det(A) < 0$, the transformation also reverses orientation.

### Characterization and Uniqueness
The determinant is characterized by three key properties:
1. Multilinearity in rows/columns
2. Alternating property (zero when rows/columns are identical)
3. Normalization ($\det(I) = 1$)

This characterization shows that any function satisfying these properties must be the determinant, establishing its fundamental nature in linear algebra.

### Computational Methods
The chapter provides multiple approaches to computing determinants:
- The sum formula (using permutations)
- Expansion by cofactors (Laplace expansion)
- Reduction to triangular form using elementary operations

Each method has different advantages depending on the matrix structure and computation context.

### Determinants and Invertibility
A key result is that a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. This provides an elegant test for invertibility and leads to the adjugate formula for calculating inverses: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\operatorname{adj}(A)$.

## Section Summaries

### 2.1 Determinants: the sum formula
This section introduces the determinant using the sum formula, which expresses it as a sum over all permutations of products of matrix entries. The sign map for permutations is defined, and basic properties of determinants are established, including values for special matrices (identity, triangular, etc.) and effects of elementary operations.

### 2.2 Properties of Determinants
This section explores the fundamental properties of determinants: multilinearity and the alternating property. These properties explain why elementary operations affect determinants in specific ways and provide tools for efficient determinant calculation through row/column operations.

### 2.3 Characterization of Determinants
This section proves that any function satisfying multilinearity and the alternating property must be proportional to the determinant. This characterization is used to establish the product formula: $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$, which has important consequences for matrix invertibility and similar matrices.

### 2.4 Minors, Adjugates and Inverses
This section develops the concepts of minors, cofactors, and the adjugate matrix to provide a formula for matrix inversion. The relationship $A\operatorname{adj}(A) = \det(A)I$ leads directly to the inverse formula when $\det(A) \neq 0$.

## Important Results
1. **Determinant Sum Formula**: $\det A = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n}(\operatorname{sgn} \sigma) a_{\sigma(1)1} \ldots a_{\sigma(n)n}$
2. **Effects of Elementary Operations**:
   - Type I (scaling): $\det(\hat{A}) = \lambda \det(A)$
   - Type II (addition): $\det(\hat{A}) = \det(A)$
   - Type III (swapping): $\det(\hat{A}) = -\det(A)$
3. **Product Formula**: $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$
4. **Determinant of Transpose**: $\det(A^T) = \det(A)$
5. **Characterization Theorem**: Any multilinear alternating function $D$ with $D(I)=1$ must be the determinant
6. **Invertibility Criterion**: A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero
7. **Laplace Expansion**: $\det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{ij}C_{ij}(A)$ for any row $i$
8. **Adjugate Relation**: $A\operatorname{adj}(A) = \operatorname{adj}(A)A = \det(A)I$
9. **Inverse Formula**: $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)}\operatorname{adj}(A)$ when $\det(A) \neq 0$

## Applications
1. **Matrix Invertibility**: Determining whether a matrix is invertible by computing its determinant
2. **Matrix Inversion**: Computing the inverse of a matrix using the adjugate formula
3. **Linear Systems**: Solving systems of linear equations using Cramer's rule (derived from determinants)
4. **Volume Calculation**: Computing volumes of parallelepipeds and other geometric transformations
5. **Change of Variables**: Determinant appears in the formula for change of variables in multiple integrals
6. **Eigenvalue Problems**: The characteristic polynomial's coefficients are related to determinants
7. **Linear Operator Classification**: Properties of determinants help classify linear operators

## Connections to Other Chapters
- **Chapter 1 (Vector Spaces)**: Determinants provide a test for linear independence and help understand linear transformations
- **Chapter 3 (expected)**: Eigenvalues and characteristic polynomials likely connect to determinants
- **Chapter 4 (expected)**: Inner product spaces and orthogonality likely relate to determinant properties

## Practice Problems
See the problem sets PS01 and PS02 for exercises that reinforce the concepts from this chapter. Key types of problems include:
- Computing determinants using various methods
- Proving properties of determinants
- Finding inverses using the adjugate formula
- Applications to linear systems and geometry

## Summary
Determinants are a powerful tool that connect numerous aspects of linear algebra. They provide a single scalar value that encapsulates critical information about a matrix or linear transformation, including invertibility, volume scaling, and orientation preservation. The methods developed in this chapter for computing determinants and matrix inverses have both theoretical importance and practical applications throughout mathematics and its applications.
