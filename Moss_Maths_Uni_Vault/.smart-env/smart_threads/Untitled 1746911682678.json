            "content": "Okay, let's break down eigenvalues and how to revise for them.\n\n## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: The Summary\n\n**What are they?**\n\nImagine you have a square matrix `A`. This matrix represents a linear transformation (like a rotation, scaling, shearing, etc.).\n*   An **eigenvector** (`v`) of `A` is a non-zero vector that, when the transformation `A` is applied to it, **does not change its direction**. It only gets scaled.\n*   The **eigenvalue** (`λ`, lambda) is the scalar factor by which the eigenvector is scaled.\n\n**The Core Equation:**\n\n`Av = λv`\n\nWhere:\n*   `A` is an n x n square matrix.\n*   `v` is an n x 1 non-zero column vector (the eigenvector).\n*   `λ` is a scalar (the eigenvalue).\n\n**Why are they important?**\n\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors reveal fundamental properties of the linear transformation represented by the matrix:\n1.  **Principal Directions/Axes:** Eigenvectors point in directions that are preserved (only scaled) by the transformation.\n2.  **Scaling Factors:** Eigenvalues tell you how much stretching or shrinking occurs along these principal directions.\n    *   `|λ| > 1`: Stretching\n    *   `|λ| < 1`: Shrinking\n    *   `λ < 0`: Direction is reversed\n    *   `λ = 1`: Vector is unchanged (lies in the \"eigenspace\" for λ=1)\n    *   `λ = 0`: Vector is mapped to the zero vector (lies in the null space/kernel of A)\n3.  **Matrix Diagonalisation:** If a matrix has enough linearly independent eigenvectors, it can be diagonalised. This simplifies many matrix operations (like calculating powers of a matrix: `A^k = P D^k P⁻¹`).\n4.  **Stability Analysis:** In dynamical systems (e.g., `dx/dt = Ax`), the signs and magnitudes of eigenvalues determine the stability of equilibrium points.\n5.  **Data Analysis:** Used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find directions of maximum variance in data.\n6.  **Vibrational Analysis:** Eigenvalues correspond to natural frequencies of vibration in mechanical systems.\n\n**How to find them:**\n\n1.  **Find Eigenvalues (λ):**\n    *   Start with `Av = λv`.\n    *   Rearrange: `Av - λv = 0`\n    *   Factor out `v`: `(A - λI)v = 0` (where `I` is the identity matrix).\n    *   For this equation to have a non-zero solution for `v`, the matrix `(A - λI)` must be singular (i.e., its determinant must be zero).\n    *   So, solve the **characteristic equation**: `det(A - λI) = 0`. This will be a polynomial in `λ`. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues.\n\n2.  **Find Eigenvectors (v):**\n    *   For each eigenvalue `λ` found, substitute it back into `(A - λI)v = 0`.\n    *   Solve this system of linear equations for `v`. This usually involves row reduction (Gaussian elimination).\n    *   The solution will give you the eigenvector(s) corresponding to that eigenvalue. There will be at least one free variable, meaning there are infinitely many eigenvectors for each eigenvalue (they form a subspace called the eigenspace). You typically pick a simple representative vector.\n\n**Key Properties to Remember:**\n\n*   The sum of eigenvalues = Trace of `A` (sum of diagonal elements).\n*   The product of eigenvalues = Determinant of `A`.\n*   Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.\n*   For symmetric matrices (A = Aᵀ):\n    *   Eigenvalues are always real.\n    *   Eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.\n*   A matrix is diagonalisable if and only if it has `n` linearly independent eigenvectors (where `n` is the dimension of the matrix). This happens if the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue equals its geometric multiplicity.\n    *   **Algebraic Multiplicity:** The number of times an eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial.\n    *   **Geometric Multiplicity:** The dimension of the eigenspace for that eigenvalue (i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenvectors for that eigenvalue).\n\n## How to Revise for Eigenvalue Questions\n\n1.  **Master the Definitions and Core Equation:**\n    *   What is an eigenvalue? What is an eigenvector?\n    *   Be able to write down and explain `Av = λv`.\n    *   Understand the geometric interpretation (scaling, not changing direction).\n\n2.  **Practice the Calculation Process (Crucial!):**\n    *   **Finding Eigenvalues:**\n        *   Setting up `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n        *   Calculating determinants (especially for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices).\n        *   Solving the resulting polynomial (quadratic formula, factoring, synthetic division for cubics if needed, or looking for simple integer roots like 0, 1, -1).\n    *   **Finding Eigenvectors:**\n        *   Substituting each `λ` back into `(A - λI)v = 0`.\n        *   Performing Gaussian elimination/row reduction accurately to solve the system.\n        *   Expressing the solution in terms of free variables and picking representative eigenvectors.\n    *   **Start with 2x2 matrices, then move to 3x3.** Errors in arithmetic are common, so be meticulous.\n\n3.  **Understand Key Properties and Theorems:**\n    *   Trace/Determinant relationships (useful for checking answers).\n    *   Properties of symmetric matrices (real eigenvalues, orthogonal eigenvectors).\n    *   Linear independence of eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues.\n    *   Conditions for diagonalisability (algebraic vs. geometric multiplicity).\n        *   If all eigenvalues are distinct, the matrix is diagonalisable.\n        *   If there are repeated eigenvalues, you *must* check if you can find enough linearly independent eigenvectors.\n\n4.  **Diagonalisation:**\n    *   Know *why* it's useful (e.g., `A^k = P D^k P⁻¹`).\n    *   Practice constructing `P` (columns are eigenvectors) and `D` (diagonal entries are eigenvalues, in the same order as eigenvectors in `P`).\n    *   Practice finding `P⁻¹` (especially for 2x2 matrices).\n\n5.  **Work Through Various Question Types:**\n    *   \"Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix A.\" (Standard calculation)\n    *   \"Is matrix A diagonalisable? If so, find P and D such that A = PDP⁻¹.\"\n    *   \"Given that `λ` is an eigenvalue of A, show that `λ^2` is an eigenvalue of `A^2`.\" (Proof-based, using the definition `Av = λv`).\n    *   \"If `v` is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue `λ`, is `v` an eigenvector of `A + cI`? If so, what is its eigenvalue?\"\n    *   Questions involving properties: \"Given eigenvalues, find det(A) or trace(A).\"\n    *   Questions about symmetric matrices.\n    *   Simple application questions (e.g., stability of a 2D system `x' = Ax`).\n\n6.  **Revision Techniques:**\n    *   **Flashcards:** For definitions, properties, and theorems.\n    *   **Worked Examples:** Go through examples in your textbook/notes step-by-step. Then try to do them yourself without looking.\n    *   **Past Papers/Problem Sets:** This is the most effective way. Time yourself.\n    *   **Summarize:** Create your own summary sheet of key concepts, formulas, and procedures.\n    *   **Teach Someone:** Explaining it to someone else solidifies your understanding.\n    *   **Identify Weaknesses:** If you consistently make errors in determinant calculations, practice those. If you struggle with row reduction, focus there.\n\n7.  **Common Pitfalls to Watch For:**\n    *   **Arithmetic errors:** Especially when calculating determinants or solving systems. Double-check!\n    *   **Forgetting `I`:** Writing `det(A - λ) = 0` instead of `det(A - λI) = 0`.\n    *   **Incorrectly solving for eigenvectors:** Ensure you get a system with free variables. If you get a unique solution (only `v=0`), something is wrong with your eigenvalue or your setup.\n    *   **Normalisation:** Eigenvectors are often normalised (made into unit vectors), but this isn't always required unless specified. Understand when and why.\n    *   **Order of eigenvalues/eigenvectors in P and D:** They must correspond.\n\nBy focusing on both the \"how-to-calculate\" and the \"why-it-matters,\" you'll be well-prepared for eigenvalue questions.
