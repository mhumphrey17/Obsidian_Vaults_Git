# Algebra Semester 2 - Glossary

This glossary contains definitions of key terms used throughout the course. Each term links to its full note for more detailed information.

## A

- **Adjugate Matrix**: The transpose of the cofactor matrix of a given matrix. Used in the formula for matrix inverses.
- **Additive Group**: A set with addition and a zero element satisfying certain axioms.

## B

- **Basis**: A list of vectors in a vector space that is both linearly independent and spanning.

## C

- **Change of Basis**: A transformation that converts representations of vectors from one basis to another.
- **Cofactor**: The signed minor of a matrix element, used in calculating determinants.
- **Column Rank**: The dimension of the column space of a matrix.

## D

- **Determinant**: A scalar value calculated from a square matrix that has various important interpretations.
- **Dimension**: The number of vectors in any basis of a vector space.

## E

- **Eigenvalue**: A scalar 位 such that Av = 位v for some non-zero vector v.
- **Eigenvector**: A non-zero vector v such that Av = 位v for some scalar 位.

## F

- **Field**: A set with addition and multiplication operations satisfying certain axioms.

## I

- **Image**: The set of all outputs of a linear map.
- **Inner Product**: A generalization of the dot product to abstract vector spaces.
- **Isomorphism**: A bijective linear map between vector spaces.

## K

- **Kernel**: The set of vectors that a linear map sends to zero.

## L

- **Linear Combination**: A sum of vectors each multiplied by a scalar.
- **Linear Independence**: A property of vectors where none can be written as a linear combination of the others.
- **Linear Map**: A function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication.

## M

- **Matrix Representation**: A way to represent a linear map using a matrix relative to chosen bases.
- **Minor**: The determinant of a submatrix obtained by deleting one row and one column.

## S

- **Spectral Theorem**: States that certain operators can be diagonalized by an orthogonal change of basis.
- **Spanning**: A property of a set of vectors that can generate the entire vector space through linear combinations.
