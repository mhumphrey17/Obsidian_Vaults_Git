# PS01-Q03: Linearity of Projection Map

## Problem Statement
Let $\phi$ be the projection onto the line $L: y = x$ in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. Show that $\phi$ is linear.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Map|Linear maps]] and their defining properties
- [[Matrix Representation|Matrix representation]] of linear transformations
- Geometric projections
- Verification of linearity properties

## Approach
1. Identify the geometric properties of the projection onto the line $y = x$
2. Find a formula for the projection of an arbitrary point $(x, y)$ onto the line
3. Verify the two key properties that define a linear map:
   - $\phi(u + v) = \phi(u) + \phi(v)$ (preserves addition)
   - $\phi(\lambda v) = \lambda \phi(v)$ (preserves scalar multiplication)
4. Alternatively, express the projection as a matrix transformation and use the fact that all matrix transformations are linear

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q03-Solution]]
