# PS01-Q04: Solving Linear Systems with Parameters

## Problem Statement
For $A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}2 & 2 & 6 \\ 4 & 5 & 9 \\ -1 & 2 & s\end{array}\right), b=\left(\begin{array}{l}2 \\ 5 \\ t\end{array}\right)$, find the values of $s, t \in \mathbb{R}$ for which the linear system $A \cdot x = b$ has (i) a unique solution, (ii) no solution, (iii) infinitely many solutions. In case (iii), find the general solution.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Map|Linear maps]] and their properties
- [[Rank|Rank]] of a matrix and how it affects solution spaces
- [[Nullity|Nullity]] and its relation to the number of free parameters
- [[Gaussian Elimination|Gaussian elimination]] for solving parametric systems
- [[Rank-Nullity Theorem|Rank-Nullity Theorem]] for understanding the dimension of solution spaces

## Approach
1. Use Gaussian elimination on the augmented matrix $[A|b]$ to transform it into row echelon form, keeping the parameters $s$ and $t$
2. Analyze how the parameters affect the rank of the coefficient matrix and the consistency of the system
3. For case (i), determine when the system has a unique solution by finding when the coefficient matrix has full rank
4. For case (ii), determine when the system is inconsistent by finding when the rank of the augmented matrix exceeds the rank of the coefficient matrix
5. For case (iii), determine when the system has infinitely many solutions and find the general solution by parameterizing the free variables

## Solution
