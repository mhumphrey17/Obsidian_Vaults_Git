# PS01-Q08: Subspaces of Function Spaces
## Problem Statement
Let $V=C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$ be the vector space of infinitely differentiable functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Which of the following are linear subspaces of $V$? Give reasons.

(i) the solutions of $\frac{d^{2} f}{d x^{2}}+4 f=0$,
(ii) the solutions of $\frac{d^{2} f}{d x^{2}}+4 x^{2}=0$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Subspace]]: A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space under the same operations
- [[Vector Space]]: A set with operations of addition and scalar multiplication that satisfy specific axioms
- [[Function Space]]: A vector space whose elements are functions
- [[Differential Equations]]: Equations involving functions and their derivatives

## Approach
To determine if a set is a linear subspace, check the following properties:
1. The zero vector (zero function in this case) must be in the set
2. The set must be closed under vector addition 
3. The set must be closed under scalar multiplication

For sets defined by differential equations:
1. Check if the zero function is a solution to the equation
2. Check if linear combinations of solutions remain solutions

## Solution
