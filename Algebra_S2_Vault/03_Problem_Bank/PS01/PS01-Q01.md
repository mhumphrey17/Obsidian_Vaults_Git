# PS01-Q01: Linear System Solvability and Invertibility

## Problem Statement
True or False? The linear system $A \cdot x = b$ has a solution for every $b$ if and only if $A$ is invertible.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Map|Linear Maps]] and their properties
- [[Matrix Representation|Matrix Transformations]]
- [[Image|Image of a linear map]]
- [[Kernel|Kernel of a linear map]]
- Surjectivity of linear maps
- Invertibility of matrices

## Approach
1. Analyze what it means for a system to have a solution for every $b$
2. Connect this property to surjectivity of the linear map $\phi_A$
3. Consider the relationship between surjectivity and invertibility
4. Determine whether surjectivity implies invertibility without additional conditions

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q01-Solution]]
