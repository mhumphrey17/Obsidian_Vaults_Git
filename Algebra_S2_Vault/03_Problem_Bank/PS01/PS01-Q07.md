# PS01-Q07: Kernel and Image of Projection Map
## Problem Statement
Let $\phi$ be the projection onto the line $L: y=x$ in the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ (as described in Question 3). Compute the $\operatorname{ker} \phi$ and $\operatorname{im} \phi$.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Kernel]]: The set of all vectors that map to the zero vector under a linear transformation
- [[Image]]: The set of all possible outputs of a linear transformation
- [[Linear Map]]: A function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication
- [[Projection]]: A linear transformation that maps vectors onto a subspace

## Approach
To find the kernel and image of this projection:
1. Recall the formula for the projection $\phi$ from Question 3
2. For the kernel, find all points $(x,y)$ such that $\phi(x,y) = (0,0)$
3. For the image, determine the set of all possible output vectors
4. Use geometric intuition about projections to verify the results

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q07-Solution]]
