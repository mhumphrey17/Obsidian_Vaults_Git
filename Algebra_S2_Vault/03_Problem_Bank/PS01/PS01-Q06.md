# PS01-Q06: Linearity of Map from Fn to V
## Problem Statement
Let $\alpha$ denote a list of vectors $v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}$ in a vector space $V$ and define a map

$$\phi_{\alpha}: \mathbb{F}^{n} \rightarrow V:\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right) \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} v_{i}$$

Show that $\phi_{\alpha}$ is a linear map, stating explicitly where you use a vector space axiom.

## Key Concepts Involved
- [[Linear Map]]: A function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication
- [[Linear Combination]]: The sum of scalar multiples of vectors
- [[Vector Space]]: A set with operations of addition and scalar multiplication that satisfy certain axioms
- [[Vector Space Axioms]]: The fundamental properties that define a vector space

## Approach
To show that $\phi_{\alpha}$ is a linear map, we need to verify that it preserves both vector addition and scalar multiplication:
1. Identify the input vectors and scalars
2. Apply the definition of $\phi_{\alpha}$ to the linear combination of inputs
3. Use vector space axioms to manipulate the expression
4. Compare with the linear combination of outputs to show equality

## Solution
See [[PS01-Q06-Solution]]
