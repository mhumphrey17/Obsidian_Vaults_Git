# Rank, Nullity, and Their Applications

## Overview
This topic explores key dimensional properties of linear maps: rank (the dimension of the image) and nullity (the dimension of the kernel). The Rank-Nullity Theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between these quantities and the dimension of the domain. This relationship has profound implications for the classification of linear maps and the structure of vector spaces. The topic also covers related constructions like direct sums and sums of subspaces, with their own dimensional formulas.

## Key Concepts
- **[[Rank]]**: The dimension of the image of a linear map, measuring the "effective dimensionality" of the transformation. For a matrix, this equals the number of linearly independent rows or columns.

- **[[Nullity]]**: The dimension of the kernel of a linear map, measuring how many dimensions are "collapsed" to zero. For a matrix, this equals the number of free parameters in the general solution to the homogeneous system.

- **[[Rank-Nullity Theorem]]**: The fundamental relationship stating that for a linear map $\phi: V \rightarrow W$ from a finite-dimensional space $V$, the sum of the rank and nullity equals the dimension of the domain: $\operatorname{rank} \phi + \operatorname{null} \phi = \dim V$.

- **[[Direct Sum]]**: A construction combining vector spaces, either externally (cartesian product with component-wise operations) or internally (sum of subspaces with trivial intersection). The dimension of a direct sum equals the sum of the dimensions of the component spaces.

- **[[Sum of Subspaces]]**: The set of all vectors that can be expressed as a sum of vectors from given subspaces. The dimension formula states that $\dim(U + W) + \dim(U \cap W) = \dim U + \dim W$.

## Core Results
- **Proposition 1.8.4**: For a matrix $A$, the rank of the matrix equals the rank of the associated linear map.

- **Proposition 1.8.7**: For a matrix, the following are all equal:
  1. The rank (dimension of the image of the associated linear map)
  2. The dimension of the column space (column rank)
  3. The dimension of the row space (row rank)
  4. The smallest $r$ such that the matrix can be factored as a product of an $m \times r$ and an $r \times n$ matrix

- **Corollary 1.8.8**: The rank of a matrix equals the rank of its transpose.

- **Theorem 1.9.2 (Rank-Nullity Theorem)**: For a linear map $\phi: V \rightarrow W$ where $V$ is finite-dimensional, $\operatorname{rank} \phi + \operatorname{null} \phi = \dim V$.

- **Lemma 1.9.4**: For the external direct sum, $\dim(U \oplus W) = \dim U + \dim W$.

- **Proposition 1.9.5**: For subspaces $U$ and $W$ of a vector space $V$, $\dim(U + W) + \dim(U \cap W) = \dim U + \dim W$.

## Applications
- **Linear Systems**: The rank of the coefficient matrix determines whether a system has solutions, while the nullity determines how many free parameters there are in the solution set.

- **Linear Transformations**: The rank and nullity characterize the behavior of a linear transformation, indicating how much information is preserved or lost.

- **Vector Space Decomposition**: Direct sums allow complex vector spaces to be decomposed into simpler components that can be analyzed separately.

- **Matrix Analysis**: The rank of a matrix is a fundamental property used in matrix computations, factorizations, and approximations.

- **Data Analysis**: In applications like principal component analysis (PCA), rank is used to identify the most significant dimensions in a dataset.

## Common Problems and Approaches
### Finding the Rank and Nullity
1. For a matrix, convert to row echelon form using Gaussian elimination.
2. The rank equals the number of pivot rows (or non-zero rows in the row echelon form).
3. The nullity equals the number of columns minus the rank.
4. For a linear map, find a matrix representation and use the above process.

### Applying the Rank-Nullity Theorem
1. If two of the three quantities (rank, nullity, dimension of domain) are known, use the theorem to find the third.
2. Use the theorem to establish constraints on the possible values of rank and nullity.
3. Apply the theorem to determine if a linear map is injective (nullity = 0) or surjective (rank = dimension of codomain).

### Working with Sums of Subspaces
1. To determine if a sum is direct, check if the intersection is trivial (contains only the zero vector).
2. Use the dimension formula to find the dimension of a sum or intersection of subspaces.
3. To find a basis for a sum, combine bases for the subspaces and eliminate redundancy.

## Practice Problems
1. **[[PS01-Q01]]** - Understanding rank in the context of solvability of linear systems.
2. **[[PS01-Q04]]** - Analyzing how rank and nullity affect the number of solutions to a linear system.
3. **[[PS01-Q07]]** - Computing the kernel and image of a projection map.
4. Problems involving direct sums and sums of subspaces.

## Summary
The concepts of rank and nullity provide crucial information about the behavior of linear maps. The rank measures how much of the domain space is "preserved" in the image, while the nullity measures how much is "collapsed" to zero. The Rank-Nullity Theorem establishes that the sum of these two dimensions equals the dimension of the domain, reflecting a fundamental principle about how linear maps transform vector spaces.

This topic also covers related constructions like direct sums and sums of subspaces, with their own dimensional formulas. These constructions allow complex vector spaces to be built from or decomposed into simpler components.

Understanding rank, nullity, and their relationships is essential for both theoretical linear algebra and practical applications involving linear systems, transformations, and data analysis. These concepts provide powerful tools for characterizing and classifying linear maps and vector spaces.
